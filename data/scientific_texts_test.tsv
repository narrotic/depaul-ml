in arid and semi-arid rangelands, grazing as one of the natural or human induced processes has direct and indirect effects on structure and dynamics of plant community and ecosystems. a study was done to analyze the effects of grazing on plant species diversity and plant functional types‘ (pfts) diversity of arid and semi-arid rangelands. we analyzed plant richness and diversity data from sampling plots located in five bioclimatic zones of khabr national park containing a total of plant species. ward's hierarchical clustering was then used to cluster all plant species into eight pfts according to the chosen traits. for each site, grazing intensity was estimated in three classes (low grazing, medium and high grazing intensities). we found that as grazing intensity increased, total species richness and diversity were decreased. considering pfts as total showed the same pattern for species; however, each pft diversity and richness didn‘t display a significant different response to grazing. looking at each pft relative cover change in different grazing intensities showed that pft1 and pft8 were grazing sensitivities while pft6 and pft7 benefited from grazing and their relative cover increased consistently in response to the increased grazing intensity. pft3 and pft4 had the highest relative cover rates in moderately grazed areas. pft2 and pft5 had a complicated response to grazing and their relative cover was the minimum at moderately grazed sits. this finding may imply that grazing has completely negative impacts on the community structure and it seems that it reduces plant species and functional types‘ diversity and richness. it can be also concluded that the analyses on pfts level possibly give more insight into the grazing response of plant community in arid and semi-arid rangelands than those on species level but there is a need for further studies.	biology
une serie d’enquetes sur les filarioses humaines menee systematiquement en et dans villages de l’ouest de la haute-volta a permis de preciser la reparation de l’onchocercose, de la filariose de bancroft, de la filariose a d. perstans et du ver de guinee, ainsi que l’incidence economique de ces diverses affections.ces enquetes ont, d’autre part, permis l’etude, en ce qui concerne les deux premieres maladies, des modalites de propagation : il est en particulier remarquable que, bien que transmise a l’homme par un seul vecteur, l’onchocercose se propage dans la region etudiee, selon plusieurs modalites differentes, ce qui implique des variations dans la biologie meme du vecteur commun.un tableau des resultats releves, village par village, est annexe a la presente etude, ceci pour permettre une comparaison facile avec les observations pouvant etre faites par d’autres chercheurs, dans une region qui devrait etre mise en valeur dans les prochaines annees.	biology
objective: this study aimed to investigate the toxic effects of chromium (vi) on the placental function and reproduction in rats. for the study, the placental prolactin-growth hormone (prl-gh) gene expression, placental trophoblast cell differentiation and reproductive data were analyzed. methods: the pregnancies of f344 fisher rats were checked by the presence of a copulatory plug or sperm in the vaginal smear, which was defined as day of the pregnancy. pregnant rats were divided into the three groups. the control group was given tap water (chromium level < 0.001 ppm) and the remaining groups were given or ppm of chromium (vi) [as potassium dichromate], from day to of the pregnancy. rats were sacrificed at days and of pregnancy. the mrna levels of prl-gh and pit-1a and b isotype genes were analyzed by northern blot hybridization and reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). the hormonal concentration was analyzed by radioimmunoassay, and the differentiation of placental trophoblast cells were observed by histochemical studies. reproductive data, such as placental and fetal weights, pregnancy period, and litter size, were surveyed at day of pregnancy and after birth. a statistical analysis was carried out using the sas program (version 8.1). results: the mrna levels of the prolactin-growth hormone (prl-gh) family of genes were dose dependently reduced by chromium exposure. the mrna levels of pit-1a and b isotype genes that induce the expression of the prl-gh family of genes were also reduced by chromium exposure. the prl-gh hormonal concentration in the rat placenta, fetus and maternal blood were decreased by chromium exposure. in the middle stage of pregnancy (day 11), a high dose of chromium suppressed the differentiation of spongiotrophoblast cells that secret the prlgh hormones. in the last stage of pregnancy (day 20), a high dose of chromium induced apoptosis of placental cells. reproductive data, such as placental and fetal weights, litter size, were reduced, but the pregnancy period was extended in the group exposed to chromium compared with the controls. conclusions: chromium (vi) disrupts the ordered functions of the placenta, which leads to reproductive disorders in rats.	biology
three hundred and seventy adult skulls (284 crania of unknown sex, males and females) from gujarat state of india were examined for the incidence of non-metric variants and compared with other populations to establish the distance between them. in general the gujarati incidences are of similar order to those in other series. the mean measures of divergence between gujarati and other populations were all statistically significant (p less than 0.001). the gujarati differed most from australian aborigines, but only slightly from the burma, punjab and egypt samples. from the same material side and sex dimorphism was also tested to ascertain that how far sides and sexes can be pooled in indian sample for making comparison between populations. in gujarati population out of cranial variants only four show sex difference and in case of bilateral traits, none of the variant has shown significant (p less than 0.05) side to side difference.	biology

a specimen of an ascomycetous fungus collected during a field trip was identified as gymnoascus baran. soil samples collected from 0-20 cm depth were studied for isolation of fungi using a soil dilution plate method. based on the morphological and molecular characters the specimens were identified as gymnoascus reesii. genomic dna was extracted and a nuclear rdna region, containing the internal transcribed spacers and 5.8s gene of rdna (its) were amplified and pcr products were sequenced. amplicon was purified, sequenced and submitted to the genbank (acc. no. jq387570-71). the resulting sequence (600 bp) was submitted to a blast search to find most similar sequences in genbank. the search results showed highest similarity of iranian isolates to other isolates of g. reesii from genbank. in the light of literature on ascomycetous fungi, gymnoascus baran is a new record for iran mycoflora. the specimens are kept in fungal collection of the department of plant protection, razi university, kermanshah, iran.	biology
baboons in a captive breeding colony were monitored twice a year, and new additions were screened on arrival for shedding of herpesvirus papio (hvp2) and serologic reactivity to the agent. for individual animals tested over a period of 1.5 years, shedding of infective virus was detected in of swab specimens (3.8%), each of these incidents representing shedding by a different animal. among long-term colony animals, infective virus was recovered on only two occasions (5 of swab specimens from five individuals). in all but one instance, animals shedding virus were infants, not adults, and all animals were shedding virus in the oral cavity. one of these five instances was an isolated case, but four (three infants and one adult) were clustered within a single breeding group. molecular analyses of the hvp2 isolates from this cluster indicated that they likely arose from a single common source, probably the mother of one of the infants. none of wild-caught baboons added to the colony during this period were found to be shedding infective virus, despite 93.5% of them being seropositive for hvp2. in contrast, of adult baboons (all seropositive) transferred into the colony from another breeding colony were found to be shedding hvp2 either orally (3 of 6) or genitally (3 of 6). in addition, of juvenile baboons in this shipment were found to be shedding virus in the oropharynx. overall, of instances of hvp2 isolation were from the oropharynx rather than the genital tract, and of baboons shedding virus were infants or juveniles rather than adults. these results suggest that, although venereal transmission of hvp2 occurs among adult animals, oral infection of young, sexually immature baboons is not uncommon.	biology
background acute idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) is a serious and progressive form of lung disease, and millions of people suffer from this disease in the world. to provide clues for getting a better understanding of the mechanism of this disease, we identified and further analyzed the differential expressed genes in ipf. method in this study, we downloaded the gene expression microarray (gse10667) from gene expression omnibus (geo) database. the dataset contained a total of samples, including normal controls and diseases samples (ipf). then, we identified the differentially expressed genes between normal and disease samples with packages in r language. consequently, the ppi network was also constructed for the products of these degs, and modules in the network were analyzed by cytoscape's plug-in mcode and bingo. furthermore, enrichment analysis was performed by david to illustrate the altered pathways in ipf. the drug compounds for plk1 were screened in drugbank. results atotal of genes were identified as differentially expressed genes between normal and disease samples, and we constructed a protein-protein interaction network which included pairs of proteins. then three modules were identified in our network. function of these modules were predicted to be related to protein kinase binding, extracellular matrix structural and structural constituent of cytoskeleton, respectively. finally, we focused on module a including degs. conclusions plk1 (polo like kinge-1) in this module was predicted as a marker gene in ipf, which was related to cell cycle pathway. several compounds were found which may be the potential drug for ipf.	biology
we studied the effects of six cycles of repeated cyclophosphamide (ctx) therapy followed by restorative therapy with either granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) or g-csf on the hematopoietic stem cell compartment. stem cell function was assessed by serially transferring bone marrow cells from ctx-csf-treated mice into lethally irradiated recipient mice. bone marrow cells from mice that initially received either g-csf or gm-csf after ctx therapy more rapidly lost the ability to repopulate the recipient lymphoid organs, showed a dramatic loss of hematopoietic progenitors, a more rapid loss of cfu-s capacity, and a 40% to 50% reduction in marrow repopulating ability (mra). interleukin-1 (il-1) appeared to have little effect on the ctx-treated mice when used alone. however, when administered before the ctx-csf regimen, il-1 prevented the stem cell depletion as determined by cfu-c, cfu-s, and mra through the serial transplantation procedures. these results support the hypothesis that repeated treatments with myelosuppressive drugs followed by stimulation with the csfs may induce damage to the host stem cell compartment, and further suggest that pretreatment with il-1 before ctx therapy may prevent this stem cell damage.	biology
aim: to clarify the post-glacial biogeography of the annamite and eastern chinese ungulate faunas, and determine whether current understanding of asian mammalian biogeography is biased by pseudo-extinctions and pseudo-endemism associated with a historical extinction filter. location: modern-day specimens of giant muntjac (muntiacus vuquangensis) from the annamite mountains of laos and vietnam were compared with zooarchaeological specimens of extinct giant muntjac (m. gigas) from eastern china, and with a reference sample of northern red muntjac (m. vaginalis) from china, southeast asia and south asia. methods: we analysed a data set of antler measurements using multivariate analyses of variance (manovas), principal component analyses (pcas) and scaling relationships, to quantify morphometric variation between extinct and living giant muntjacs in relation to variation shown by a different sympatric large-bodied muntjac species. we also attempted ancient biomolecule analysis of holocene samples from china. results: although the combined giant muntjac sample can be differentiated from the reference red muntjac sample in all of our multivariate morphometric analyses, no significant differences are shown between extinct and living giant muntjacs using any analyses, matching the pattern seen when comparing conspecific red muntjac samples from across the same geographical region. main conclusions: we find no support for recognizing extinct and living giant muntjacs as distinct taxa, and post-glacial populations from china and the annamites should probably all be referred to m. gigas. the likely conspecificity of giant muntjacs across eastern and southeast asia demonstrates that current-day asian mammalian biogeography has been shaped by an extinction filter and challenges the idea that the annamite region represents a cradle of evolution; instead, it may represent a refuge of diversity for some taxa, preserving remnant pseudo-endemic populations of species that have been extirpated across other parts of their former ranges.	biology
the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi) biosynthetic pathway in trypanosoma brucei bloodstream forms includes the formation of glycolipid c. this molecule is the inositol-acylated form of the gpi anchor precursor, glycolipid a. there is no evidence for the transfer of glycolipid c to protein in vivo and the role of glycolipid c is unclear. in this paper we show that glycolipid c is not synthesised in the presence of phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (pmsf) and that glycolipid c is not an obligatory intermediate on the pathway to the formation of glycolipid a. using pulse-chase experiments we show that glycolipid a and glycolipid c are in a dynamic equilibrium and we suggest that only the forward reaction (glycolipid a conversion to glycolipid c) is inhibited by pmsf	biology

the morphological characters leading to antixenosis type of resistance, against spodoptera litura (fabr.) and capsule borer, conogethes puncliferalis guen were studied during and 2001. the castor genotypes with leaves of papaya type (rg-1766). flat (rg-2291), shallow cup (rg-2327) and small size leaves (rg-2679) were less preferred by spodoptera than those with purple (rg-1930) and large size leaves (rg-11). the capsule borer infestation was low in the genotypes with loose (rg-1934) and very loose (rg-2543) spikes and with small sized (rg-2635) and non-spiny capsules (rg-258). the castor genotypes with double and triple bloom viz., rg-2551 and were less preferred by the leafhopper, empoasca flavescens (fabr.) and exhibited lower degree of hopper burn while the zero and single blooms were more preferred. similar reaction of castor was found against thrips, while it was reverse in case of whitefly. the hybrid dch-177, with single boom was susceptible to leafhopper.	biology
parthenogenetic activation of oocytes is a helpful tool to obtain blastocysts, of which the inner cell mass may be used for derivation of embryonic stem cells. in order to improve activation and embryonic development after parthenogenesis, we tried to use sperm injection and subsequent removal of the sperm head to mimic the natural ca2+ increases by release of the oocyte activating factor. visualization of the sperm could be accomplished by hoechst staining and ultraviolet (uv) light irradiation. to exclude negative effects of this treatment, we examined toxicity on activated mouse oocytes. after activation, oocytes were incubated in hoechst or stain and exposed to uv irradiation. the effects on embryonic development were evaluated. our results showed that both types of hoechst combined with uv irradiation have toxic effects on parthenogenetically activated mouse oocytes. although activation and cleavage rate were not affected, blastocyst formation was significantly reduced. secondly, we used mitotracker staining for removal of the sperm. sperm heads were stained before injection and removed again after h. however, staining was not visible anymore in all oocytes after intracytoplasmic sperm injection. in case the sperm could be removed, most oocytes died after day. as mitotracker was also not successful, alternative methods for sperm identification should be investigated.	biology
1. the metabolism of isolated fat cells from parametrial adipose tissue of starved normal rats was studied during 8hr. incubation. 2. there was a three- to eight-fold increase in conversion of glucose into carbon dioxide, fatty acids and glycerol during the fourth to eighth hours of incubation in 4% albumin buffer over that seen during the first 4hr. of incubation. 3. the addition of growth hormone and dexamethasone to fat cells at the start of the incubation period accelerated lipolysis during the first 4hr. of incubation but no further effect was seen during the fourth to eighth hours of incubation. addition of growth hormone and dexamethasone to fat cells that had been incubated for 4hr. did not accelerate lipolysis during the next 4hr. whether fat cells were incubated with or without glucose. 4. fat cells incubated for prolonged periods also displayed a reduced sensitivity to the lipolytic action of adrenocorticotrophic hormone. 5. during prolonged incubation there was no damage to the cells as judged by the retention of two soluble cytoplasmic enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase, within the cells.	biology

the ontogeny of the l-glutamate (glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) neuronal systems in the guinea pig hippocampus was investigated with respect to tissue amino acid content, and spontaneous and k(+)-stimulated release of glu and gaba. transverse hippocampal slices were prepared from the guinea pig fetus at day (brain growth spurt), and of gestation (term, about days), from the 5-days-old neonate, and from the young adult. glu and gaba release was determined as efflux from hippocampal slices into krebs'-bicarbonate medium using a dynamic, submerged, superfusion apparatus. hippocampal glu content decreased during development, whereas gaba content was constant for all the ages investigated. the magnitude of spontaneous glu efflux decreased during development; there was no measurable spontaneous gaba efflux. the k+ concentration-glu efflux response curve was bell-shaped for the fetus at the three selected gestational ages, and was curvilinear for the neonate and adult. the apparent ec75 of k(+)-stimulated glu efflux was higher for the neonate and adult compared with the fetus. in contrast, the k+ concentration-gaba efflux response curve was curvilinear, and the apparent ec75 of k+ was similar for all the ages investigated. k(+)-stimulated efflux of glu and gaba was ca++ dependent, but this was not the case for spontaneous glu efflux. these data indicate that, in the guinea pig hippocampus, the glu neuronal system is developing throughout gestation, whereas the gaba neuronal system appears to mature before the brain growth spurt.	biology

type diabetes (t2d) has reached epidemic proportions worldwide. recent scientific investigations support that t2d is fundamentally tied to changes in mitochondrial content or oxidative capacity in insulin-sensitive tissues and in pancreas of insulin-resistant patients [1-2]. mitochondria-directed therapy could prove an effective way to prevent and/or treat diabetes, insulin resistance and diabetes complications. poxel develops imeglimin, a phase-3 ready novel oral antidiabetic agent, having already shown its safety and efficacy in clinical trials, exposing over subjects [3-4]. imeglimin was shown to regulate mitochondrial bioenergetics by redirecting substrate flows towards complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. imeglimin slightly inhibits complex and restores complex activities, suggesting an increase in fatty acid oxidation. moreover, imeglimin decreases reactive oxygen species (ros) production linked to the reverse transport of electrons from complex to complex protecting the mitochondria from ros deleterious effects. by improving mitochondrial function, imeglimin restores the organs’ sensitivity to glucose and insulin, leading to: a glucose-dependent insulin secretion increase; a glucose excess production decrease; and an increase in glucose uptake and use [5]. poxel long-term goals are to confirm imeglimin's clinical effectiveness and full mechanism-of-action in diabetic patients and advance it as a standard-of-care treatment.	biology

the regulation of growth differs between fetal and postnatal life. the growth of the fetus in late gestation is primarily determined by the availability of substrate and by the degree of maternal constraint on growth. the fetus does not grow to its maximal potential and the role of hormones in the regulation of fetal growth must be seen as that of mediating the interaction between limited substrate availability and the genetic drive to grow (see gluckman and liggins 1984; gluckman for review). by contrast, after weaning the postnatal organism is able to grow to its genetic potential, because the availability of substrate is not normally limiting. endocrine factors are thus acting to co-ordinate the growth of the postnatal organism to its maximum potential. it is therefore to be expected that the status of the somatotropic axis, the major endocrine axis involved in the regulation of growth, will differ between fetal and postnatal life.	biology

the development of greenhouse leaf yellowing in easter lilies (lilium longiflorum thunb.) was significantly reduced by the application of growth regulator solutions containing gibberellins and (ga 4+7 ) or benzyladenine (ba). solutions containing ba alone significantly reduced leaf yellowing on plants caused by close spacing but were less effective than ga 4+7 . application of ba alone, however, was not effective against root rotinduced leaf yellowing. when plants were treated with ga 4+7 or ba + ga 4+7 around the visible bud stage, nearly all of the leaves remained green until the end of the growing season. these growth regulators, however, increased the final height of the plants by 8-10 cm. the developmental rate and size of the flower buds, as well as the length of the pedicels were not affected by the growth regulator treatments. thus application of these growth regulators greatly improved the quality of the leaves without compromising the quality and timing of the flowers. chemical name used: n-(phenylmethyl)-1h-purine-6-amine (benzyladenine, ba).	biology
for laboratory diagnosis of sodium chloride poisoning, the concentration of chlorides was polarographically determined in the liver of minks (seven-month-old and older), polar and silver foxes (eight-month-old and older), coypus (nine to ten month old), turkeys (three-month-old), and pheasants. the physiological concentration of sodium chloride in the liver of mink (n = 32) is 2.47 to 3.64 g kg-1, polar foxes (n = 30) 2.46 to 4.23 g kg-1, silver foxes (n =3) 3.27 to 3.44 g kg-1, coypu (n = 23) 1.79 to 3.05 g kg-1, turkeys (n = 30) 1.0 to 2.1 g kg-1, and pheasants (n = 28) 0.95 to 2.37 g kg-1. the exposure of the organism of a pheasant to single lethal doses of common salt (3.4 and g nacl per kg 1. w.) resulted in a 2.5- to 6-fold increase of salt concentration in liver, as compared with physiological concentration. a decreased concentration of sodium chloride (lower than the physiological standard) was found in the liver of deceased lactating minks.	biology

abstract a recombinant yeast pichia pastoris carrying the gene encoding epoxide hydrolase (eh) of rhodotorula glutinis was constructed and used for producing (s)-styrene oxide by enantioselective hydrolysis of racemic mixtures of styrene oxides. the eh gene was obtained by pcr amplification of cdna of r. glutinis and integrated into the chromosomal dna of p. pastoris to express eh under the control of aox promoter. the recombinant yeast has a high hydrolytic activity toward (r)-styrene oxide as nmol min−1 (mg cell)−1, which is about 10-fold higher than that of wild type r. glutinis. when kinetic resolution was conducted by the recombinant yeast at a high initial epoxides concentration of mm that constitutes an epoxide–water two-liquid phase, chiral (s)-styrene oxide with an enantiomeric excess (e.e.) higher than 98% was obtained as 36% yield (theoretical, 50%) at h.	biology
dl-beta-hydroxybutyrate (dl-bohb) is teratogenic to rodent embryos in culture, but the biochemical mechanism(s) responsible for the induction of malformations has not been elucidated. thus, to delineate a potential mechanism, the interaction of the ketone body with embryonic glucose metabolism was investigated. mouse embryos were exposed in whole embryo culture to dl-bohb or each isomer separately during the period of neurulation. the results demonstrate that dl-bohb inhibits glucose oxidation by the pentose phosphate pathway (ppp) with no concomitant effect on krebs cycle or glycolysis. furthermore, decreased rates of embryonic uridine monophosphate and dna synthesis were produced by dl-bohb, whereas orotate synthesis was unaffected, thereby suggesting that the availability of ribose moieties synthesized by the ppp was compromised. this hypothesis was supported by the observation that addition of ribose to dl-bohb-containing medium reduced the incidence of ketone body-induced neural tube defects and maintained the rates of dna synthesis at control levels. furthermore, these biochemical alterations are due to the synergistic effects of the d and l isomers and may be related to changes in redox states.	biology
susceptibility to vancomycin and teicoplanin was studied in the most frequently isolated staphylococcus species isolated in the state hospital clinic nr in warsaw in 1994. no strains resistant to vancomycin were found in two staphylococci most frequently isolated from clinical material: s. aureus and s. epidermidis. occurrence of this resistance is very rare and is restricted only to coagulase-negative staphylococci such as s. xylosus, s. capitis, s. lentus and s. cohni. resistance to teicoplanin was observed more often (1.4% in s. aureus and from 11.8% to 39.3% in species of coagulase-negative staphylococci). for the majority of methicillin-susceptible clinical strains (80%), the mbc value did not exceed 4.0 mcg/ml of vancomycin while for almost half of the strains in the population of methicillin-resistant strains mbc values ranged from 32.0 to mcg/ml of vancomycin. moreover, vancomycin-tolerant strains were found eight times more often in the studied mrsa (26.7%) population than in mssa strains (3.3%).	biology
four pine forests (6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and 31–40 year-old) located in the cangshan mountain and erhai lake national reserve and pine forests (1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, 21–30, 31–40, and more than year-old) located in the non-protective area near the national reserve were selected. three replications of each forest was set and a total of sites were investigated. at each site, we quantified habitat variables (species richness, abundance, and percentage of grasses and shrubs coverage respectively at the bottom layer of forests) within randomly determined m × m areas. one hundred cages were set in five lines at each site to trap small mammals, whose species and numbers were recorded. dominance of dremomys pernyi and callosciurus erythraeus in small mammal communities, time niche breadth, and time niche overlap between the two small mammals were calculated, respectively. step-wise regression was used to analyze the relationship between small mammals and habitat factors. our results indicated that d. pernyi occurred earlier than c. erythraeus in protective pine forests. d. pernyi was captured in 6–10 year-old forest initially, and c. erythraeus was captured in 16–20 year-old forest initially. d. pernyi and c. erythraeus were captured in the 31–40 and 21–30 year-old forests initially in the non-protective area, respectively. populations of d. pernyi and c. erythraeus in the 31–40 year-old protective forests were and 3.75 times of those in the same-aged non-protective forests, respectively. shrubs significantly influenced the populations of the two small mammals. the population of d. pernyi was positively correlated with the density of shrubs; the population of c. allosciurus erythraeus was positively correlated with the coverage of shrubs, and negatively correlated with the coverage of grasses. d. remomys pernyi and c. allosciurus erythraeus were important for pine forests to scatter pine seeds. human activities in the nonprotective pine forests decreased the vegetation heterogeneity at the bottom layer of pine forests, postponed the occurrence of d. pernyi and c. erythraeus, and decreased the populations of the two small mammals.	biology

abstract the effect of feeding either salinomycin or monensin on feedlot performance and carcass characteristics of yearling cattle was studied. a high-forage diet consisting of corn silage and supplement alone or supplemented with 11.0 g salinomycin or 27.5 g monensin per metric ton of complete feed on a 90% dry matter basis was fed ad libitum for d. cumulative average daily gains were increased and 7% in monensin- and salinomycin- fed cattle, respectively. a decrease in feed intake for the cattle fed both ionophores occurred during the first d; however, no differences in feed intake were observed during the remainder of the trial. feed efficiency was improved 5% for the monensin and 8% for the salinomycin treatment. there were no harmful effects observed from feeding either additive, and carcass characteristics did not differ among treatments. these data indicate that both monensin and salinomycin are effective in enhancing both rate of gain and feed efficiency offeedlot cattle.	biology
in the growing chloronema cell suspension cultures of the moss funaria hygrometrica hedw., activities of several enzymes have been found to be cell-density-dependent. cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (cnpde), nitrate reductase (nr), and protein kinase showed highest activity at a low cell density (1 to milligrams per milliliter) while indoleacetic acid (iaa) oxidase and peroxidase were highest at a high cell density (>10 milligrams per milliliter). 3'-nucleotidase and the glycolytic enzymes (aldolase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, phosphoglucoisomerase, pyruvate kinase, and triose phosphate isomerase) showed no significant dependence on the cell density. alternatively, if the nr and peroxidase activities were determined as a function of time in batch cultures, their levels were maximal to and hours after subculture, respectively, the corresponding cell densities being to and milligrams per milliliter. the relationship between cell density and nr and peroxidase activities is the same, whether these enzymes are measured in batch cultures during a growth cycle or in the cells cultured at different initial inoculum densities for a constant time. conventionally enzymic changes have been correlated with growth phases; however, it is felt that the pattern of enzymic activities can also be interpreted as cell-density-dependent. in moss protonema, the dependence of cnpde, iaa oxidase, and peroxidase on cell density may play an important role in modulating the endogenous levels of iaa and camp, both of which regulate the differentiation of specific cell types (johri and desai nature new biol 245: 223-224; and handa and johri nature 259: 480-482).	biology
to investigate the clinical and biologic significance of the circulating t(14; 18)-carrying cells in follicular lymphoma (fl) patients, we analyzed the mbr/jh junction of the hybrid bcl-2/lgh gene simultaneously at the dna and rna levels by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in peripheral blood samples from patients in different remission status: before treatment, during treatment, and in complete remission (cr). of these patients, were positive either at the dna or rna level (8 with active disease and in cr). among these positive patients, rna was more often negative for patients in cr (9 of [64%]) than for patients with active disease (2 of [25%]; fisher’s exact test, p = .09). among the patients in cr with residual disease, of with rna positivity relapsed, whereas of with rna negativity and dna positivity relapsed with a median follow-up after sample collection of months (range, to months). simultaneous analysis of the bcl-2/lgh gene at the dna and rna level showed heterogeneous patterns of pcr positivity in regards to the evaluation of the biologic activity of the t(14; 18)-carrying cells. a larger study and long-term follow-up will help in determining whether the expression patterns in turn reflect the functional status of disease activity in fl patients.	biology
in preparation for embryo implantation and pregnancy, the uterine epithelium undergoes a genomic and biological transition that mediates adhesion and invasion of the blastocyst. these events resemble an inflammatory response, and the immune system likely takes an active role in the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. although glucocorticoids are primary mediators of the immune system, the functional role of glucocorticoid signaling in the uterine epithelium is not well defined. to investigate the dynamic relationship between glucocorticoids and reproductive hormones, we performed whole genome microarray analysis in a human uterine endometrial cancer cell line (ecc1 cells) treated with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (dex) alone or in combination with estradiol (e2). over 10,000 genes were significantly regulated in the presence of dexamethasone and/or estradiol. surprisingly, unique targets of dexamethasone and estradiol together represented the largest group of genes regulated. ingenuity pathway analysis found both overlapping and independent regulated networks for each hormone. several hundred genes were found to be co-regulated by dexamethasone and estradiol, including several antagonistically regulated. the effects of glucocorticoids and estradiol are primarily mediated through the glucocorticoid receptor (nr3c1) and estrogen receptor (esr1), respectively. in silico promoter analysis revealed that nr3c1 and esr1 response elements are enriched in antagonistically regulated genes, and signaling through these receptors was required for antagonism. glucocorticoid and estradiol antagonism of target genes may represent a critical junction between the immune system and female reproductive system. moreover, identification and ontology analysis of glucocorticoid-regulated genes in the uterine epithelium suggests that glucocorticoid signaling regulates important biological functions, including immune cell trafficking and embryonic development. summary sentence: whole genome microarray analysis of the human uterine epithelial cell line ecc1 reveals widespread transcriptional regulation by glucocorticoids and estradiol and identifies many genes that are targets for both of these steroid hormones.	biology

n. meningitidis infections represent a global health problem that can lead to the development of serious permanent sequelae. although the use of antibiotics and prevention via vaccination have reduced the incidence of meningococcal disease, our understanding regarding n. meningitidis pathogenesis is still limited, especially of those mechanisms responsible for imd and fulminant or deadly septic shock. these severe clinical presentations occur in a limited number of subjects, whereas about 10% of healthy individuals are estimated to carry the bacteria as a commensal. since tlr activation is involved in the defense against n. meningitidis, several studies have highlighted the association between host tlr snps and a higher susceptibility and severity of n. meningitidis infections. moreover, tlr snps induced variations in immunological responses and in their persistence upon vaccination against meningococcal disease. in the absence of mass vaccination programs, the early identification of risk factors for meningococcal disease would be recommended in order to start immunization strategies and antibiotic treatment in those subjects carrying the risk variants. in addition, it could allow us to identify individuals with a higher risk for severe disease and sequelae in order to develop a personalized healthcare of high-risk subjects based on their genomic profile. in this review, we have illustrated important preliminary correlations between tlr variants and meningococcal susceptibility/severity and with vaccine-induced immune responses.	biology

cysticercosis and hydatidosis are cyclozoonotic diseases of current importance to both public and animal health authorities throughout the world. taenia taeniaeformis in the field is cycled through rodents (rats and mice) as intermediate hosts while the cat serves as the definitive host in a predator-prey relationship. the intermediate host becomes parasitized after the ingestion of infective eggs. taeniid parasites possess the capacity to stimulate a strong immune response to the invasive larval stages, a response which is capable of destroying an infective challenge but seems incapable of eliminating the established parasites of the primary infection. at present the mechanisms by which these parasites are able to evade the efferent arm of the immune response remain undetermined. however, the natural host-parasite relationship offered by the experimental model of taeniasis, taenia taeniaeformis in the rat, provides a means to experimentally examine both the host's response to the parasite as well as the parasite's response to the host in an effort to gain further insight into the phenomenon of prolonged survival.	biology
we have previously reported that compared to a corn oil diet a fish oil diet (5% by weight) fed to b10r.iii mice before the induction of collagen induced arthritis markedly reduced disease severity. in this study we determine whether a fish oil diet could reduce the severity of collagen induced arthritis if begun after the arthritis was clinically apparent. mice were initially fed either a fish oil or corn oil diet and immunized with bovine type ii collagen weeks later. at the onset of collagen-induced arthritis, half of the corn oil fed mice were switched to fish oil and arthritis assessed on a weekly basis. four weeks after the diet change until killing weeks later, the mice switched to fish oil developed much less severe arthritis than the corn oil fed controls. thus the severity index of corn oil fed mice ranged between 9.4 and 7.1; the severity index of fish oil fed mice was between 6.8 and 4.3 while the mice switched to fish oil ranged between 7.2 and 5.6. analysis of peritoneal macrophages weeks after immunization showed that macrophages from fish oil fed mice incorporated eicosapentaenoic acid into phospholipids and produced less arachidonate products than corn oil fed mice. there was no difference between macrophages obtained from mice switched from corn oil to fish oil and those maintained on fish oil with respect to fatty acid composition of membrane phospholipids or prostaglandin profile. these results suggest that arthritis severity may be modulated after the onset of cia by altering the pg profile of macrophages present at inflammatory sites.	biology

this study attempts to explain the concept of the real in terms of intensity, manifestation, and performance, and then outlines key aspects of the politics of the real. the politics of the real is based on an interruption of identification and an abrupt end of continuity, and intensity, manifestation, and performance are the modalities of the politics of the real. first, intensity is the principle of punctualization. it denotes an anti-dialectic and anti-systematic enterprise that aims to leave behind the paradigm of continuity. it acts as the counter-principle to overcome the hegelian dialectic and historicism. it concerns the dimension before the formation of identity and thus functions as a categorical rejection of ontological identity. consequently, it evolves into a figure of future politics, because it denies identity and instead affirms new inventions. second, manifestation is a matter of politics, because politics shows itself as a matter of visibility and demonstration. ultimately, politics is the fight over manifestation. furthermore, manifestation is the modality of existence of the collective, since a new arising collective always manifests itself in the space of images. finally, performance is an action concept and thus opposed to the static world-model. hence, the world appears as the place for restructuring and reshaping. performance renders reference and the classical notion of mimesis obsolete. it undermines the distinction between original and copy and instead affirms the permanent generating of new relations and nexuses. hence, it is the generation of freedom. ultimately, it acts as a disappearing intermediary between virtual intensity and actual manifestation. it is an anti-metaphysical concept of possibility that differs strictly from metaphysical possibility. thus, intensity, manifestation, and performance each correspond to the virtual, actual, and possible of the real and thus are to be denoted as modalities of the politics of the real.	sociology
a commitment to ‘thin universalism’ is a commitment to the possibility ofuniversal principles. the thought is that there are at least some basic principles of political morality that apply everywhere, despite the wide variety ofdistinct accounts of the good life, of competing conceptions of just politicalorganisation and of particular communities and cultures. such universalismis ‘thin’ as a response to the challenge posed to the justification of universalprinciples by this moral and political pluralism. it is the recognition of thispluralism that leads walzer away from what he refers to as a ‘thick’ coveringlaw universalism to his account of a thin reiterative universalism that acceptsthe inescapability of particular contexts (chapter of this volume). he understands the thickness of covering-law universalism to be dependent on adenial of pluralism, or at least on a denial that the existence of different communities, cultures and world views, each with their own values and understanding of morality, makes any significant difference to the justification ofprinciples. instead walzer regards these particular contexts as constitutive ofmorality, value and identity; our ‘thick’ cultures and languages make us whowe are and shape our self-understandings. therefore, justification must takethis basic pluralism seriously and any universal justification will exist in apossible ‘thin’ space of sympathetic overlap between ‘thick’ cultures. forwalzer, any universalism must accept the constraints imposed by pluralismand in doing so will find its justification both necessarily thin and also limited by, or tied to, the variety of thick particular moralities. as walzer understands it, a thin universalism is never only thin, nor is it ever only universal,but always retains its links to thick and particular contexts each with its thickset of social understandings.1	sociology

the park chung hee period was when a fully fledged modern nation state was formed. as nation state is intimately joined with the process of capitalistic expansion and reproduction, the park regime’s modernization project can be summed up as an expansion of capitalism and construction of national subjectivity. farmers, workers, and university students, while occupying different sociopolitical locations in society, were unitary subjects insofar as they were actively mobilized for the modernization project. this paper argues that in the process of mobilization, the state exercised both coercion and politics of consent; the state’s developmentalism was conjoined with the people’s egalitarian desire for a better life. the people did not just passively follow the state, but also actively and enthusiastically participated in the state’s mobilization drive. the park regime was also an active practitioner of mass politics. the dominant state discourse of developmentalism and nationalism reappropriated as its own the egalitarian pressure coming from below, making its politics not just of repression but also of desire. unlike the politics of discrimination of the pre-modern period, the park regime pursued the nationalization of society and people by interpellating the disparate people into a unified national subjectivity.	sociology

this article problematizes the role of autobiographical narratives in adult learning and suggests that the life histories produced by adult learners in our classrooms are, in important senses, fictions. rather than being the free expressions of experience and selfhood, students’ narratives are multiply overdetermined, both by the cultural frames that are available to them and by the conditions of story-telling in our classrooms. these include the values and assumptions that underlie our practices, the aspects of self that are called into being by the narratives we elicit, and the conventions of character and plot within which our students are taught to write thus for all our valorizing of individuality and uniqueness, there are only some stories we allow our students to tell and only some forms of selfhood we allow to emerge in the process of telling them.	sociology
participation in the rhythms and processes of twentieth-century capitalism depended upon physical mobility, particularly in a city as geographically dispersed as los angeles. this fluid individual mobility also served to justify the introduction of new law enforcement practices that increasingly sought to rationalize urban space. how did the literature and cinema of los angeles represent the experiences of citizens for whom mobility was both vital and potentially incriminating? within such an environment, i propose, successful orientation became particularly crucial. i develop an original but historically grounded theorization of disorientation as a concept through which to interpret the unease and vulnerability of individual protagonists as they navigate the city. whilst drawing on a wide body of theoretical sources, my research remains rooted in the close analysis of cinematic and literary texts, and the specific historical and geographical context with which they engage. the automobility of raymond chandler’s philip marlowe allows him to navigate the dispersed topography of 1940s la, but his investigations are often ineffectual and leave him weary and jaded. the protagonist of chester himes’s if he hollers let him go (1945) struggles to orientate himself within a wartime los angeles in which racism is manifested spatially. himes’s novel provides a lens through which to view the experience of 1970s south la depicted in the films of charles burnett and haile gerima, in which the city’s african-american community confronts disorientating conditions of circumscribed movement and arbitrary incrimination. lawenforcement officials exert spatial control in the novels of joseph wambaugh and james ellroy, but they also find themselves compromised by jurisdictional conflicts. pursuing careful analyses of character, form and setting, this project explicates some of the compelling and troubling visions of urban experience that los angeles has prompted, and challenges a critical tendency to elide aspects of the city’s racial past.	sociology

this article examines how the melancholic tradition of korean literature takes a new turn toward epistemological disillusionment through kim young-ha’s (kim yŏngha) novel k’wijŭ syo (quiz show, 2007). on the rapidly shifting horizons of unprecedented stability and prosperity, while exposed to the alienating effects of the newly emergent media-driven society where the meaning of community becomes fragmented and obscured behind scintillating screens clamoring with masked identities, writers of this era and thereon faced the double-bind of an ironic grief over the “loss of a shared sense of loss (beloved values)” that upheld the realist tradition, such as sovereignty, political integrity, and economic stability. focusing on the gaps and overlaps between the representative functions of conventional media such as film, and the disconcertingly visceral incarnations of human desire and fallacy we see in the simulacra of new media platforms including cellphone texts and internet chat rooms, this article suggests that quiz show responds to this challenge by highlighting the impossibility of “knowing,” whether the subject is one’s own self, institutional values, or even the very fabrics of reality. reading the protagonist’s misadventures through tortuous passages of failed communication, representation, and simulation of new ideals, i discuss the story as a reflection on the identity crisis korea’s younger generations were wading through amid the material abundance and ideological void in the 1990s. the spectral fragments of electronically mediated interaction we see throughout the novel, i claim, is an inquiry into what one may be, or even how one cannot be anyone at all, in a society where nothing can be safely identified or identified with anymore.	sociology

for centuries, the al-qur'an translator was dominated by men while women's participation in the translation of the qur'an was still very minimal. this means, only the experience of men involved in the process of translating the qur'an finally the qur'an is only understood according to men's views. therefore, this article aims to look at the translation of the female qur'an. does the involvement of women in the translation of the qur'an necessitate translations that uphold the principles of egalitarianism as the ideology of feminism or only continue the translation of the qur'an written by men who support patriarchal ideology? by using a critical linguistic approach that aims to find out the ideology in the translation of the qur'an through language analysis, the authors conclude that some translations of women's qur'an affirm the translation of the male al-qur'an in favor of the patriarchal ideology reflected in the use of vocabulary protector, managers, have charge of, overseer, beat and hit. while others bring feminism ideology that upholds the principles of egalitarianism and justice which are reflected in the use of the word to support, supporter, maintainer, separate, ignore / disregard / push, and go away from.	sociology
this paper presents a first prototype of mobeybou, a digital manipulative that uses physical blocks to interact with digital content. it intends to create an environment for promoting the development of language and narrative competences as well as digital literacy among pre and primary school children. mobeybou offers a variety of characters, objects and landscapes from various cultures around the world and can be used for creating multicultural narratives. an interactive app developed for each country provides additional cultural and geographical information. a pilot study carried out with a group of 3rd graders showed that mobeybou motivated and inspired them to actively and collaboratively create narratives integrating elements from the different countries. this may indicate mobeybou's potential to promote multiculturalism.	sociology
this essay argues that machines filled a sacred purpose in the middle of the twentieth century that has gone unrecognized by scholars of religion. the mennonites who hosted african-american children from urban environments for one- to two-week stays in the country used tractors to promote their religious fresh air programs. from through tractors also figured prominently in the children’s testimonies about their rural sojourns. fresh air hosts, promoters, and participants thus used a diesel-powered machine for religious ends and, in so doing, featured an industrialized product as a symbol of a natural retreat. mennonite fresh air programs also reveal similarities between the city and country that religious and secular narratives of the period have obscured. scholarship in the tradition of leo marx will be enriched by shifting attention from the chronology of machine-based industrialization to the uses of machines in natural settings for religious purposes.	sociology
division of administrative powers is the result of concrete decisions made by the supreme power holders (ius eminens) to be present in the daily life of an individual. quarters, district offices (in slovene: “kresije” [pl.]), counting offices, recruitment districts, and district boards were those agents of power that were used by the supreme power holder to ensure the common good through them. the holder‟s power originated from the supreme power holder. it was restricted by the degree at which he operated. according to the nature of things, the power was subordinated by the delegated competences, and they functioned on the principle of subsidiarity, or it was autonomous under control in the case of the church. pragmatism of each supreme power holder is reflected in observing the divisions in operation. they most frequently emerged from the controlled autonomy. keywords: • jurisdiction • administration • institution • hierarchical character of bureaucratic apparatus • administrative history • roman catholic church	sociology

the role of university educators has changed over the past decade, influenced by changing technology, institutional and funding pressures. this quantitative study builds on saban et al’s (2007) previous work on metaphors of teachers to explore contemporary student and teacher conceptualisations of a university teacher and the implications for an online environment. findings suggest that while a congruency was found, there was a shift to legitimising concepts of being an expert and being suitably qualified. the dichotomy of personal and behavioural qualities provide a conceptual extension to the earlier work.	sociology

this article criticizes the increasingly popular idea that global civil society (gcs) represents an appealing model of or strategy for global democracy. after briefly reviewing the arguments for conceiving global democracy and democratization in terms of gcs, it distinguishes two models of civil society's democratic role at the state level on which these claims rest. it shows that neither successfully survives transposition to the supranational setting. in both cases the purported democratic functions and effects of civil society depend on assumptions that do not hold globally. proponents of gcs as a model of global democracy do not adequately conceptualize global democracy or democratization. this failure points to broader epistemological problems in theorizing global politics and global democracy. in place of strategies to extend and apply existing democratic theory globally, we need a theory of global democracy.	sociology

this article responds to the question: what elements of the culture of image dynamize the body as a value? following in the footsteps of the german philosopher, helmuth plessner, i start from eccentric positionality, which is the fundamental structure of human existence. it allows for the formulation of the law of the utopian centre, which states that man has always aimed at the absolute although its full realization is impossible. it further assumes that thinking is a systemic principle for which the body is a carrier, especially of a form which we label cultural identity. hence, the body comprises the signiﬁ cant part of the identity project, which is inscribed in the broader cultural context. i assert that the culture-creating activity of man is anchored in a very human ability to perceive the world as a symbol, i.e. symbolic projection. considering the dynamics of the body we must also consider the aesthetic index since the symbolic function of language becomes real in discourse; it is a linguistic occurrence, or the use of language	sociology
in this paper an attempt has been made to analysis of income and human development index (hdi) on poverty ratio for states of india and for some selected asian nation. our hypothesis is that both hdi and the growth of per capita income to play a significant role in the perspective of reduction of poverty. data pertaining to major states of india has been considered to study the linkages between these three variables over time with the help of correlation and regression technique. the empirical analysis clearly revealed that per capita income and human development have profound influence on the reduction of poverty. another important result is that over time the linkage between the three variables is getting strengthened. while there is a sizeable decline in poverty ratio of majority of states, still there is a long way to go. it may be concluded by saying that greater attention needs to be paid to human development mainly by increasing budgetary and plan expenditure on social sector and generation of ample employment opportunities.	sociology
