protein-l-isoaspartate (d-aspartate) o-methyltransferases (ec 2.1.1.77) that catalyze the transfer of methyl groups from s-adenosylmethionine to abnormal l-isoaspartyl and d-aspartyl residues in a variety of peptides and proteins are widely distributed in procaryotes and eucaryotes. these enzymes participate in the repair of spontaneous protein damage by facilitating the conversion of l-isoaspartyl and d-aspartyl residues to normal l-aspartyl residues. in this work, we have identified an l-isoaspartyl methyltransferase activity in arabidopsis thaliana, a dicotyledonous plant of the mustard family. the highest levels of activity were detected in seeds. using degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to two highly conserved amino acid regions shared among the escherichia coli, wheat, and human enzymes, we isolated and sequenced a full-length genomic clone encoding the a. thaliana methyltransferase. several methyltransferase cdnas were also characterized, including ones that would encode full-length polypeptides of amino acid residues. messenger rnas for the a. thaliana enzyme were found in a variety of tissues that did not contain significant amounts of active enzyme suggesting the possibility of translational or posttranslational controls on methyltransferase levels. we have identified a putative abscisic acid-response element (abre) in the 5′-untranslated region of the a. thaliana l-isoaspartyl methyltransferase gene and have shown that the expression of the mrna is responsive to exogenous abscisic acid (aba), but not to the environmental stresses of salt or drought. the expression of the a. thaliana enzyme appears to be regulated in a distinct fashion from that seen in wheat or in animal tissues.	biology
deubiquitinating enzymes (dubs), capable of removing ubiquitin (ub) from protein substrates, are involved in numerous biological processes. the ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolases (uchs) subfamily of dubs consists of four members: uch-l1, uch-l3, uch37 and brca1-associated protein-1 (bap1). uch-l1 possesses deubiquitinating activity and dimerization-dependent ubiquitin ligase activity, and functions as a mono-ubiquitin stabilizer; uch-l3 does both deubiquitinating and deneddylating activity, except dimerization or ligase activity, and unlike uch-l1, can interact with lys48-linked ub dimers to protect it from degradation and in the meanwhile to inhibit its hydrolase activity; uch37 is responsible for the deubiquitinating activity in the 19s proteasome regulatory complex, and as indicated by the recent study, uch37 is also associated with the human ino80 chromatin-remodeling complex (hino80) in the nucleus and can be activated via transient association of 19s regulatory particle- or proteasome-bound hrpn13 with hino80; bap1, binding to the wild-type brca1 ring finger domain, is regarded as a tumor suppressor, but for such suppressing activity, as demonstrated otherwise, both deubiquitinating activity and nucleus localization are required. there is growing evidence that uch enzymes and human malignancies are closely correlated. previous studies have shown that uch enzymes play a crucial role in some signalings and cell-cycle regulation. in this review, we provided an insight into the relation between uch enzymes and oncogenesis.	biology
abstract lake trout salvelinus namaycush were extirpated from lake michigan by the early 1950s, and as part of an effort to restore naturally reproducing populations, hatchery-reared fish have been stocked since the early 1960s. stocked fish are marked with a fin clip to differentiate them from wild, lake-produced lake trout; marking error for the 2007–2010 year-classes of lake trout stocked by federal hatcheries averaged 3.0%. egg deposition, emergent fry, and wild juvenile lake trout have previously been observed, but no sustained wild recruitment has been measured in assessment surveys or in sport and commercial fishery catches. in and we caught juvenile lake trout in gill-net and bottom trawl catches that were targeting bloater coregonus hoyi in water depths greater than m. unclipped, wild lake trout represented 20% of all lake trout caught in a southern offshore region of lake michigan. in northwestern lake michigan wild recruits represented from 10% to 27% of the 2007–2009 year-classes...	biology
in a previous study, we observed increased protective activity against acid precipitation of poly (u) in the serum of tumor bearing mice and hepatoma patients. in the present study we purified and partially characterized the protein responsible for this phenomenon and measured the activity in the serum of patients with various cancers. evidence is presented that this protein forms a complex with serum ribonucleases which results in the inactivation of enzymes and protection of rna from acid precipitation. the serum protective activity against acid precipitation of poly (u) was measured in patients with gastrointestinal cancer and with gynecological cancer, along with male subjects with nonmalignant diseases of the gastrointestinal system, with uterine leiomyoma, healthy men and healthy women from the hospital personnel. the mean values found in patients with various tumors were about three times higher than those found in healthy individuals, while no significant overlapping of values was observed between cancer patients and controls. on the other hand, the activity was not increased in patients with nonmalignant diseases of gastrointestinal system and uterus.	biology
matrix metalloproteinase-13 (mmp-13), referred to as collagenase-3, is a proteolytic enzyme that plays a key role in degradation and remodelling of host extracellular matrix proteins. the objective of this study was to characterize the mmp-13 gene in channel catfish, and to determine its pattern of expression in various healthy tissues and during embryogenesis. since mmp-13 has been shown to have importance in tissue remodelling and some pathological processes, we further studied its involvement in the defense responses of catfish after bacterial infection. the channel catfish mmp-13 cdna contains an open reading frame of bp encoding amino acids. using rt-pcr analysis, mmp-13 was widely expressed in various health tissues. using quantitative real-time pcr analysis, expression of mmp-13 gene was up-regulated by bacterial infection. during normal embryological development, mmp-13 expression was slightly increased in the first day post-fertilization and sharply up-regulated from 1-day post-fertilization through hatching.	biology
among the modes of transmission available to the cytomegalovirus (cmv) is sexual transmission, primarily via semen. both male-to-female (m-f) and male-to-male (m-m) sexual transmission significantly contribute toward the spread of cmv infections in the global population. semen plays an important role in carrying the viral particle that invades the vaginal or rectal mucosa, thereby initiating viral replication. both semen and seminal plasma (sp) can enhance hiv-1 infection in cell culture, and two amyloid fibrils, semen-derived enhancer of viral infection (sevi) and amyloids derived from the semenogelins (sem amyloids), have been identified as seminal factors sufficient to enhance hiv-1 infection (j. munch et al., cell 131:1059-1071, 2007; n. r. roan et al., cell host microbe 10:541-550, 2011; f. arnold et al., j. virol. 86:1244-1249, 2012). whether sp, sevi, or sem amyloids can enhance other viral infections has not been extensively examined. in this study, we found that sp, sevi, and sem amyloids strongly enhance both human cmv (hcmv) and murine cmv infection in cell culture. sevi and sem amyloids increased infection rates by >10-fold, as determined by both flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. viral replication was increased by 50- to 100-fold. moreover, viral growth curve assays showed that sp, sevi, and sem amyloids sped up the kinetics of cmv replication such that the virus reached its replicative peak more quickly. finally, we discovered that sem amyloids and sevi counteracted the effect of anti-gh in protecting against cmv infection. collectively, the data suggest that semen enhances cmv infection through interactions between semen amyloid fibrils and viral particles, and these interactions may prevent hcmv from being neutralized by anti-gh antibody.	biology
abstract during hiv infection, cd4 + -cell numbers and cd4/cd8 ratios decline in the blood. this is usually attributed to direct viral killing or to other indirect mechanisms. however, current models generally assume that such changes in the blood are representative of changes in total cd4 + -cell numbers throughout the body. this article discusses the importance of alterations in cd4 + - and cd8 + -cell migration in regulating blood lymphocyte levels and questions the extent of virus-mediated cd4 + -cell destruction.	biology
summary a mass emergence of chironomus anthracinus (zetterstedt) took place at loch leven, kinross, in late may and early june leading to a large concentration of egg masses. the distribution of egg masses within the lake was determined on june and the accumulation of egg masses along wind-exposed shores, under the influence of a 17–23 km h−1 wind, was noted. oviposition site selection by the weak flying adults appears to have little importance upon the final distribution of larvae within the lake. temporary planktonic activity of first instar larvae under the influence of wind-induced water currents is briefly discussed as a dispersal mechanism in the light of observed egg mass accumulation in the lake.	biology
we used a modified functional balance (fb) model to predict growth response of helianthus annuus l. to elevated co2. model predictions were evaluated against measurements obtained twice during the experiment. there was a good agreement between model predictions of relative growth rate (rgr) responses to elevated co2and observations, particularly at the second harvest. the model was then used to compare the relative effects of biomass allocation to roots, nitrogen (n) uptake and photosynthetic n-use efficiency (pnue) in determining plant growth response to elevated co2. the model predicted that a rather substantial increase in biomass allocation to root growth had little effect on whole plant growth response to elevated co2, suggesting that plasticity in root allocation is relatively unimportant in determining growth response. average n uptake rate at elevated compared to ambient co2was decreased by 21–29%. in contrast, elevated co2increased pnue by approx. 50% due to a corresponding rise in the co2-saturation factor for carboxylation at elevated co2. the model predicted that the decreased n uptake rate at elevated co2lowered rgr modestly, but this effect was counterbalanced by an increase in pnue resulting in a positive co2effect on growth. increased pnue may also explain why in many experiments elevated co2enhances biomass accumulation despite a significant drop in tissue nitrogen concentration. the formulation of the fb model as presented here successfully predicted plant growth responses to elevated co2. it also proved effective in resolving which plant properties had the greatest leverage on such responses.	biology
abstract the physical state of epstein barr virus (ebv) dna was analyzed in the burkitt's lymphoma (bl) cell line bl60 and in the autologous ebv-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell line (lcl) iarc by gardella gel analysis, southern blotting, and nonradioactive in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes. although only episomal viral dna was detected in the lcl, the 6–12 copies of ebv dna in the bl cell line are integrated in one site of the host cell genome. the integration site is located near the breakpoint of a translocation 11;19 which is present in this cell line in addition to the bl-specific t(8;22).	biology
abstract malnutrition from the last week of gestation resulted in significant diminution in weight and total protein content of cerebral cortex of 12- and 24-day-old rats. in synaptosomal fractions from cerebral cortices of 24-day-old malnourished rats the recovery of protein and of acetylcholinesterase and choline acetyltransferase activity per gram of fresh tissue was higher than in the controls. quantitative morphologic studies showed no difference in the composition of synaptosomal fractions from malnourished and control rats. the higher yield in protein. ache and chac of synaptosome fractions may indicate that presynaptic endings are relatively spared by perinatal malnutrition, however, the possibility that these results are due to an altered distribution of the presynaptic endings among the various subcellular fractions cannot be ruled out.	biology

introduction the hepatitis b virus (hbv) genome contains four orfs, s (surface), p (polymerase), c (core) and x. s is completely overlapped by p and as a consequence the overlapping region is subject to distinctive evolutionary constraints compared to the remainder of the genome. specifically, a non-synonymous substitution in one coding frame may produce a synonymous substitution in the alternative frame, suggesting a possible conflict between requirements for diversifying and purifying forces. to examine how these contrasting requirements are balanced within this region, we investigated the relationship amongst positive selection sites, conserved regions, epitopes and elements of protein structure to consider how hbv balances the contrasting evolutionary pressures. methodology/results hbv genotype d genome sequences were collected and analyzed to identify sites under positive selection and highly conserved regions. epitopes sequences were retrieved from previously published experimental studies stored in the immune epitope database. predicted secondary structures were used to investigate the association between structure and conservation. entropy was used as a measure of conservation and bivariate logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between positive selection/conserved sites and epitope/secondary structure regions. our results indicate: (i) conservation in s is primarily dictated by α-helix elements in the protein structure, (ii) variable residues are mainly located in pres, the major hydrophilic region (mhr) and the c-terminus, (iii) epitopes in s, which are directly targeted by the host immune system, are significantly associated with sites under positive selection. conclusions the highly variable spacer domain in p, which corresponds to pres in s, appears to act as a harbor for the accumulation of mutations that can provide flexibility for conformational changes and responding to immune pressure.	biology
five mutants defective in tolerance toward a high concentration of nacl (10%), kcl (10%), and glucose (60 %) in zygosaccharomyces rouxii were isolated. these mutants were divided into two recessive and two dominant classes designated sat1, sat2, sat3, and sat4. the sat1 and sat3 mutants are defective in nacl tolerance, but have kcl and glucose tolerance. the sat2 and sat4 mutants are sensitive for these three substances in a certain concentration. these facts suggest that there are two different mechanisms for the salt and glucose tolerances.	biology
the hiv-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 interacts consecutively with cd4 and the ccr5 coreceptor to mediate the entry of certain hiv-1 strains into target cells. acidic residues and sulfotyrosines in the amino-terminal domain (nt) of ccr5 are crucial for viral fusion and entry. we tested the binding of a panel of ccr5 nt peptides to different soluble gp120/cd4 complexes and anti-ccr5 mabs. the tyrosine residues in the peptides were sulfated, phosphorylated, or unmodified. none of the gp120/cd4 complexes associated with peptides containing unmodified or phosphorylated tyrosines. the gp120/cd4 complexes containing envelope glycoproteins from isolates that use ccr5 as a coreceptor associated with nt peptides containing sulfotyrosines but not with peptides containing sulfotyrosines in scrambled nt sequences. finally, only peptides containing sulfotyrosines inhibited the entry of an r5 isolate. our data show that proper posttranslational modification of the ccr5 nt is required for gp120 binding and viral entry. more importantly, the nt domain determines the specificity of the interaction between ccr5 and gp120s from isolates that use this coreceptor.	biology
object the receptor for advanced glycation end products (rage) may play an important role in inflammatory processes and endothelial activation, likely to accelerate the processes of atherosclerosis, especially in patients with diabetes. the factors that regulate the expression of rage are not completely clear. c-reactive protein (crp) is identified as a key proinflammatory cytokine in patients with atherosclerosis. atherosclerosis also induces reduction and dysfunction of endothelial progenitor cells (epcs), a main cell type for vascular repair. therefore, we tested the hypothesis that crp can regulate rage expression and alter antioxidant defenses in epcs. methods and results epcs, isolated from bone marrow, were cultured in the absence or presence of lipopolysaccharide-free crp (5, and microg/ml). rage protein expression was measured by flow cytometric analysis and western blot. rage messenger rna expression was detected by polymerase chain reaction. reactive oxygen species (ros) were analyzed using the ros assay kit. a spectrophotometer was used to assess superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity, and polymerase chain reaction was used to test messenger rna expression of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. apoptosis was evaluated by annexin v immunostaining. coculturing with crp caused a significant upregulate expression of rage in epcs, increased ros production, altered antioxidant defenses, and induced epc apoptosis. in addition, these effects were attenuated during blocking rage protein expression by small interfering rna. conclusions crp at concentrations known to predict cardiovascular event may serve to impair epc antioxidant defenses for upregulating the expression of rage and promote epc sensitivity toward oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis. these data further support a direct role of crp in the development and/or progression of atherosclerosis.	biology

this article reports the first preparation of miniantibodies to azospirillum brasilense sp245 surface antigens by using a combinatorial phage library of sheep antibodies. the prepared phage antibodies were used for the first time for lipopolysaccharide and flagellin detection by dot assay, electro-optical analysis of cell suspensions, and transmission electron microscopy. interaction of a. brasilense sp245 with antilipopolysaccharide and antiflagellin phage-displayed miniantibodies caused the magnitude of the electro-optical signal to change considerably. the electro-optical results were in good agreement with the electron microscopic data. this is the first reported possibility of employing phage-displayed miniantibodies in bacterial detection aided by electro-optical analysis of cell suspensions.	biology
abstract abdim’s storks ciconia abdimii were studied in a post-breeding staging area dominated by sahelian grasslands in southeastern niger. in late september a total of 5,763 birds was recorded on systematic transect counts. the estimated density was 5.66 per km2, equivalent to a total of c. 17,000 abdim’s stork within the utilized area of 3,000 km2. a high percentage of juveniles in the flocks in late august, when the nigerien breeding population is still at their nests, indicate a southern origin of the birds. the storks probably make northward post-breeding movements into the sahel to feed on locally abundant food supplies, first of all senegalese grasshopper oedaleus senegalensis, the dominant grasshopper species in the area. the mean density of oedaleus in late september was 11.2 per m2 (6.7 g fresh weight/m2). storks feeding on grasshoppers made on average 5.6 successful pecks per min during their first h of daily feeding, enabling them to fulfil 95% of their daily energy requirements wi...	biology
test errors are much greater than usually thought and their investigation requires good statistical design. analysis of variance of blind randomized trials is especially valuable. for representative selections of tests currently used in bacterial taxonomy and identification, the discrepancies within one laboratory are usually less than 4%; with care they can be reduced to 2% or less. between-laboratory variation is much greater; discrepancies of about 8% are usual under routine conditions, and even 15% is common. the effect of errors on identification is due to (a) error in the reference descriptions of taxa, (b) error in the description of the unknown strain to be identified. simultaneous polythetic methods (e.g., using matching coefficients or analogues of these) are robust to both types of error, and misidentifications are usually minor in degree, i.e., the unknown is allocated to a taxon close to the correct one. the rate of failure is expected to be greatest when the reference descriptions are based on the tightest clusters. sequential identification methods are especially sensitive to errors because the unknown may then be allocated to a taxon far from the correct one. monothetic sequential keys are sensitive to errors of type (b), whereas type (a) error is usually screened out during construction of the key.	biology
inner centromere protein (incenp) and centromere protein e (cenpe) are two functionally important proteins of the higher eukaryotic centromere. using a mouse incenp genomic dna and a mouse cenpe cdna to analyze recombinant inbred mouse sets, as well as interspecific backcross panels, we have mapped these genes to the proximal regions of mouse chromosomes and respectively. comparison of cenpe and human cenpe, which maps to chromosome region 4q24→q25, has further identified a new region of homology between the two species.	biology
leptin can enhance thymopoiesis and modulate the t-cell immune response. however, it remains controversial whether these effects correlate with the expression of leptin receptor, obr. we herein addressed this issue by using in vivo animal models and in vitro culture systems. leptin treatment in both ob/ob mice and normal young mice induced increases of cd4 sp thymocytes in thymus and cd4 t cells in the periphery. interestingly, expression of the long form obr was significantly restricted to dn, dp and cd4 sp, but not cd8 sp thymocytes. moreover, in the reaggregated dp thymocyte cultures with leptin plus tscs, leptin profoundly induced differentiation of cd4 sp but not cd8 sp thymocytes, suggesting that the effects of leptin on thymocyte differentiation might be closely related to the expression of leptin receptor in developing thymocytes. surprisingly, obr expression was markedly higher in peripheral cd4 t cells than that in cd8 t cells. furthermore, leptin treatment with or without il-2 and pha had preferential effects on cell proliferation of cd4 t cells compared to that of cd8 t cells. collectively, these data provide evidence that the effects of leptin on differentiation and proliferation of cd4 t cells might be closely related to the expression of leptin receptor.	biology
the ridgetail white prawn exopalaemon carinicauda is one of the most important commercial species in eastern china. however, little information of immune genes in e. carinicauda has been reported. to identify distinctive genes associated with immunity, an expressed sequence tag (est) library was constructed from hemocytes of e. carinicauda. a total of clones were sequenced, yielding ests and the average sequence length is bp. the cluster and assembly analysis yielded unique sequences including contigs and singletons. blast analysis identified (56.3%) of the unique sequences as orthologs of genes from other organisms (e-value < 1e-5). based on the cog and gene ontology (go), unique sequences were classified. through comparison with previous studies, genes assembled from ests have been identified as possibly involved in defense or immune functions. these genes are categorized into seven categories according to their putative functions in shrimp immune system: antimicrobial peptides, prophenoloxidase activating system, antioxidant defense systems, chaperone proteins, clottable proteins, pattern recognition receptors and other immune-related genes. according to est abundance, the major immune-related genes were thioredoxin (141, 4.94% of all ests) and calmodulin (14, 0.49% of all ests). the est sequences of e. carinicauda hemocytes provide important information of the immune system and lay the groundwork for development of molecular markers related to disease resistance in prawn species.	biology
proceedings: aacr annual meeting 2014; april 5-9, 2014; san diego, cametastasis of cancer cells to distant sites leads to poor prognosis and comprises approximately 90% of cancer mortalities. it is evident that metastasis requires resistance to anoikis, an apoptotic program induced by detachment from the extracellular matrix. heat shock proteins (hsps) are molecular chaperones whose major functions include protein folding and suppression of apoptosis, and are transcriptionally regulated by heat shock transcription factor-1 (hsf1). hsf1 has been linked to metastasis and promotes anchorage-independent proliferation of breast cancer cells. hsp60 is a chaperone found in both the mitochondria and cytosol and is linked to metastasis and regulation of tumor cell apoptosis. to investigate whether hsf1 and hsp60 are necessary for anoikis resistance, anchorage-dependent lung carcinoma (a549, h460) and normal lung epithelial (beas-2b) cells were suspended by plating on poly-2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate-coated culture dishes. anoikis induction was measured by executioner caspase-7 cleavage and parp cleavage by western blot. protein expression was measured by western blot. small-interfering rnas were used to inhibit hsf1 and hsp60. we show here that upon detachment for 24-48h, lung cancer cells resisted caspase-dependent anoikis in contrast to normal lung epithelial cells, with a549 cells showing the highest level of anoikis resistance. after 24h detachment there was increased phosphorylation of hsf1 on activating serine in lung cancer cells. antisense inhibition of hsf1 and hsp60 in attached lung cancer cells had minimal effects on caspase-7 and parp cleavage. in contrast, hsf1 and hsp60 knockdown in cancer cells that were suspended for 24-48h initiated caspase-dependent anoikis. furthermore, knockdown of hsf1 resulted in inhibition of hsp72, hsp40, and hsp27. hsp60 was not significantly inhibited with loss of hsf1. this data suggests that hsf1 and hsp60 are necessary for lung carcinoma anoikis resistance. our work adds to evidence suggesting hsf1 and hsp60 are promising therapeutic targets for metastasis prevention. although more detailed mechanistic evaluation is necessary, a therapeutic approach to induce anoikis in circulating tumor cells by modulating hsf1 or hsp60 may be promising.citation format: jack d. carter, suzanne k. murphy. heat shock transcription factor-1 and heat shock protein are important for lung carcinoma anoikis resistance.

immuno-enzyme histochemical investigations showed that, in the magnocellular hypothalamo-hypophysial neurosecretory system of the rat, vasopressin and oxytocin are synthetized in separate neurons. both the vasopressin neurons and the oxytocin neurons are present in both the supraoptic and the paraventricular nuclei in about the same number. preferential location of the two kinds of rat neurosecretory neurons is not as obvious as in the bovine hypothalamus. their perikarya do not show distinct morphological differences. the two kinds of neurosecretory perikarya are the origin of separate vasopressin-containing and oxytocin-containing axons respectively. in the neural lobe, the distribution of the two different types of axons is described.	biology
. an extract vaccine against vibrio anguillarum was compared with other vaccine preparations when administered to rainbow trout intraperitoneally or orally on food. intraperitoneal vaccination resulted in virtually 100% protection within two weeks whereas oral vaccination gave a maximum protection of 50–70% after eight weeks. when administered intraperitoneally the extract performed better than formalin killed cells but when administered orally formalin killed cells were better. the addition of alum as adjuvant enhanced the response to antigen administered by both routes. serum agglutinin litres after oral vaccination were low and variable but after intraperitoneal injection they reached a consistent peak of 64. as the response to oral vaccination was so low it was not possible to relate agglutinin titre to protection in a quantitative relationship.	biology

prey distribution, patch size, and the presence of conspecifics are important factors influencing a predator’s feeding tactics, including the decision to feed individually or socially. little is known about group behaviour in seabirds as they spend most of their lives in the marine environment where it is difficult to observe their foraging activities. in this study, we report on at-sea foraging associations of little penguins (eudyptula minor) during the breeding season. individuals could be categorised as (1) not associating; (2) associating when departing from and/or returning to the colony; or (3) at sea when travelling, diving or performing synchronised dives. out of separate foraging tracks, (69.0%) involved associations with conspecifics. furthermore, in a total of (46.4%), individuals were found to dive during association and in (38.1%), individuals were found to exhibit synchronous diving. these behaviours suggest little penguins forage in groups, could synchronise their underwater movements and potentially cooperate to concentrate their small schooling prey.	biology
a b s t r a c t the flowers of amyema miquelei and a. miraculosum are protandrous and pollinated by birds. their dry-type stigmatic surface is composed of unicellular papillae. at the male phase, these papillae are constricted with rugulose surfaces. during the transition to the female (pollen receptive) phase these cells expand, almost doubling in width while their surface becomes much smoother. beneath the thin proteinaceous pellicle, the papillar wall consists of an extraordinarily thick bi-layered cuticle overlying the primary wall. the two layers of the cuticle are stained by lipid dyes, but are distinguished by their different responses to other cytochemical tests. the reaction product for the enzyme esterase is present within crenulations on the papillar surface in small amounts, and in dense deposits in the cuticular clefts at the base between papillae. not surprisingly, pollen tubes are unable to penetrate the thick papillar cap and enter the style through these clefts. the unusual thickness of the cuticle is interpreted as an adaptive response	biology
heat tolerant fungi are organisms that may perform bioconversion processes and produce industrially important metabolites. they may either be obligate thermophiles or simple thermotolerants. the present document is the continuation of a critical note on thermotolerant fungi erroneously reported in the literature as possessing thermophilic attributes. fifty strictly thermotolerant taxa are here considered. some of their binomials have only recently been introduced in the scientific literature. the reported thermotolerant species are grouped according to broad taxonomic categories. the nomenclature of zygomycetous taxa and anamorphic fungi is straightforward, as usually only one binomial is available or only one state is produced in culture respectively. for ascomycetes regularly producing in culture a conidial state, the name of the sexual state (teleomorph) should be used to designate the organism even when a binomial is available for the anamorph; this prevents the practice of interchangeably using the name of either states of the same fungus. when ascomycetous taxa produce the anamorph regularly and the teleomorph only under specific cultural conditions, the name of the anamorph could be preferentially selected. the goal is to introduce uniformity in name citations of fungi, particularly in the literature of applied research. each species is reported under its taxonomically correct name, either the original binomial or the latest combined binomial after generic transfer(s). known synonyms are also specified. maximum efforts were undertaken to trace updated information on the taxonomic position of these fifty strict thermotolerant species. for each, information on the type material, morphological features distinguishing it from related members of the genus (and when necessary a generic taxonomic assessment) and, finally, salient ecological features including heat tolerance levels are given. for some information on their biotechnological use is also provided. overall strictly thermotolerant fungi are so far documented in the corresponding published and present contributions; however, this figure should not be regarded as exhaustive for the group. among these taxa ascomycetous fungi (46) presently outnumber anamorphic microfungi (28) but their relevant figures should be regarded as provisional. only zygomycetous species proved to be strict thermotolerants. further cardinal temperature growth values established for these thermotolerants disclose no pattern linked to their broad taxonomic categories. standardized growth temperature curves at increments smaller than °c have to be performed to assess conclusively variability in growth temperature relationships. several heat tolerant fungi are widely used in industry; however, more research is needed to explore the applied potential of these particular organisms. an exhaustive document on the biodiversity of heat tolerant fungi also awaits production. it would be informative in relation to the global warming process of the earth.	biology
summary glial cells are crucial regulators of synapse formation, elimination, and plasticity [1, 2]. in vitro studies have begun to identify glial-derived synaptogenic factors [1], but neuron-glia signaling events during synapse formation in vivo remain poorly defined. the coordinated development of pre- and postsynaptic compartments at the drosophila neuromuscular junction (nmj) depends on a muscle-secreted retrograde signal, the tgf-β/bmp glass bottom boat (gbb) [3, 4]. muscle-derived gbb activates the tgf-β receptors wishful thinking (wit) and either saxophone (sax) or thick veins (tkv) in motor neurons [3, 4]. this induces phosphorylation of mad (p-mad) in motor neurons, its translocation into the nucleus with a co-smad, and activation of transcriptional programs controlling presynaptic bouton growth [5]. here we show that nmj glia release the tgf-β ligand maverick (mav), which likely activates the muscle activin-type receptor punt to potently modulate gbb-dependent retrograde signaling and synaptic growth. loss of glial mav results in strikingly reduced p-mad at nmjs, decreased gbb transcription in muscle, and in turn reduced muscle-to-motor neuron retrograde tgf-β/bmp signaling. we propose that by controlling gbb release from muscle, glial cells fine tune the ability of motor neurons to extend new synaptic boutons in correlation to muscle growth. our work identifies a novel glia-derived synaptogenic factor by which glia modulate synapse formation in vivo.	biology
during the past decade we and others have shown that bone is a storehouse for growth factors. accordingly, bone contains a number of growth factors including insulin-like growth factors i and ii (igf-i, igf-ii) transforming growth factor (tgf-beta tgf-beta 2), platelet-derived growth factor, basic and acidic fibroblast growth factor, and bone morphogenetic proteins (bmps). osteoblasts have been shown to produce many of these growth factors, which then act in an autocrine and paracrine fashion. the production of these growth factors is regulated by both systemic hormones and local mechanical stress. recent studies on the relative distribution of bone growth factors during different physiologic and pathologic situations indicate that the concentration of bone growth factors is not invariant and provide indirect evidence that growth factors deposited in bone have physiologic significance. in addition, many of these bone growth factors have been shown to increase bone formation either systemically or locally in vivo. based on the past findings, we propose that different growth factors may have a specific role in regulating proliferation and differentiation of different stages of osteoblast lineage cells and play important roles in the local regulation of bone formation.	biology
pichinde virus preparations were investigated for ribosomal components and associated activities. after detergent treatment and fractionation, viral components were assayed for polypeptide synthesis, elongation of nascent polypeptide chains, and mrna activity. it was demonstrated that these subviral particles could synthesize polypeptides when exogenous mrna template, aminoacyl--trnas, translation factors, gtp and appropriate cations were added. undisrupted, whole virions could not synthesize polypeptide; disruption and subsequent centrifugation of subviral ribosomes was a prerequisite for the biosynthetic activity described.	biology
abstract small bioactive peptides, with diverse biological functions, have received increasing attention as physiologically beneficial substances in animal production. the main obstacle to wide application of small bioactive peptides is a lack of cost-effective methods for mass production. in this study, we used glycyl-glutamine (gly-gln) as a test case to develop a novel mass-production method for small bioactive peptides. the oligonucleotide encoding gly-gln pro-peptide (gpp) was designed and synthesized. gpp includes gly-gln dipeptides and enzymatic sites for pepsin and trypase, allowing direct digestion and absorption of gly-gln in the gastrointestinal tract. the gpp oligonucleotides were linked to generate an oligomeric oligonucleotide segment containing tandem copies of gpp. this 12gpp segment was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli vector pet32a. by optimizing culture conditions [0.1 mmol l −1 isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (iptg), μg ml −1 ampicillin (amp), 30°c for h], the thioredoxin fusion peptides reached 40% of total bacterial protein. after purification, the fusion protein was fed to kunming mice to determine its effect on mouse immune function. the results showed that similar to gly-gln dipeptide, gpp polymer protein could significantly suppress the proliferation of t and b lymphocytes in blood and spleen, and additionally could significantly improve interleukin-2 (il-2) and interleukin-6 (il-6) secretion of blood and spleen lymphocytes. these effects were not observed in mice fed a amino acids mix (glycine and glutamine). these evidences indicated that an efficient digestion of gpp polymer protein could be achieved when ingested into the animal gut. the expression system in this study provides a potential production method for not only gly-gln dipeptide but also other short bioactive peptides.	biology
the gene expression regulation of the na+-dependent high affinity glutamate/aspartate transporter glast expressed in cultured bergmann glia cells from chick cerebellum was studied. a bp fragment of the chick glast cdna was cloned and sequenced. specific pcr primers were used to quantify chick glast mrna levels. treatment of the cells with the ca2+/diacylglycerol dependent protein kinase c (pkc) activator, phorbol 12-tetradecanoyl-13-acetate (tpa) produced a decrease in transporter mrna levels, without an effect in its mrna half life, suggesting a transcriptional down regulation. activation of the camp pathway results in a transient decrease in glast mrna levels, in contrast with the tpa effect. these findings suggest that glast expression is under control of distinct signaling pathways.	biology
ftsz, a homolog of eukaryotic tubulin, is involved in the process of cell division, particularly in septum formation in bacteria. the primary amino acid sequences of this protein are fairly conserved in prokaryotes. we observed that a eukaryotic-type ser/thr protein kinase, pkna from mycobacterium tuberculosis, when expressed in escherichia coli exhibited cell elongation due to a defect in septum formation. we found that ftsz either from escherichia coli (eftsz) or from m. tuberculosis (mftsz) was phosphorylated on co-expression with pkna. consistent with these observations, solid phase binding and in vitro kinase assays revealed the ability of pkna to interact with mftsz protein and also to phosphorylate it. we, therefore, ascertained mftsz as a substrate of pkna. furthermore, the phosphorylated mftsz exhibited impairment in its gtp hydrolysis and polymerization abilities. thus, our results highlighted the ability of pkna to phosphorylate as well as to regulate the functionality of ftsz, the protein central to cell division throughout the bacterial lineage.	biology
summary physical and chemical composition of some walnut (juglans regia l) genotypes grown in turkey. walnut (juglans regia l.) samples were collected during the and harvests from different selections of trees grown in turkey. important physical and biochemical properties of fruit were examined in these walnut types. at the end of this study, types were selected and nut and kernel properties, fatty acid composition and the proximate composition of these selections which are commonly grown in turkey were evaluated. physical properties are attributed to the quality criteria of nuts. investigated genotypes showed good quality according to the test results. the total oil content ranged from 61.97 to 70.92% while the crude protein ranged from 15.17 to 19.24%. ash ranged from 1.26 to 2.06% while the moisture was found between 3.25-3.91% of the kernel. the total carbohydrate was calculated as between 8.05-13.23%. the oleic acid content of the oils ranged from 21.18 to 40.20% of the total fatty acids, while the linoleic acid content ranged from 43.94 to 60.12% and the linolenic contents from 6.91 to11.52%. it was found that palmitic acid was between 5.24 and 7.62%, while stearic acid ranged from 2.56 to 3.67%.	biology
why and how we age remains a topic that has kept molecular biologists busy for the past few decades. in recent years, several studies pointed to sirtuins as important players in lifespan regulation, yet, in vivo proof for most of the mammalian homologs was missing. in this issue of the embo journal, sinclair and colleagues provide novel evidence that sirt2 is indeed a critical modulator of aging in vivo.	biology
abstract we have characterized cis-acting elements involved in light regulation of the nuclear gene (gapa) encoding the a subunit of chloroplast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) in arabidopsis thaliana. our results show that a 1.1-kb promoter fragment of the gapa gene is sufficient to confer light inducibility and organ specificity in transgenic nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) plants, using the beta-glucuronidase gene of escherichia coli as the reporter gene. deletion analysis indicates that the -359 to -110 bp region of the gapa gene is necessary for light responsiveness. within this region there are three copies of a decamer repeat (termed the gap box) having the consensus sequence 5'-caaatgaa(a/g)a-3', which has not been characterized in the promoter regions of other light-regulated genes. a deletion (to -247) producing loss of one copy of these elements from the gapa promoter reduces light induction by two- to threefold compared with a promoter deletion (to -359) with all three gap boxes present, while deletion of all three gap boxes (to -110) abolishes light induction completely. gel mobility shift experiments using tobacco nuclei as the source of nuclear proteins show that gapa promoter fragments that contain these repeats bind strongly to a factor in the nuclear extract and that binding can be abolished by synthetic competitors consisting only of a monomer or dimer of the gap box. furthermore, a trimer, dimer, and monomer of the gap box show binding activity and, like the authentic gapa promoter-derived probes, show binding activities that are correlated with gap box copy number. these results strongly suggest that these repeats play important roles in light regulation of the gapa gene of a. thaliana.	biology

abstract it has been hypothesized ( reichardt and kaiser, ) that transcription of the λ genes c i and rex , which code for repressor and rex protein, respectively, can be initiated at either of two sites depending on whether or not repressor itself is present. on infection of a sensitive cell, transcription of repressor ( c i) and rex mrna is thought to be initiated at a “promoter for establishment of repressor synthesis” ( pre ); however, in an established lysogen, in the presence of active repressor, synthesis of c i- rex mrna appears to be initiated at a “promoter for maintenance of repressor synthesis” ( prm ), whose existence has been inferred from several indirect observations ( bode and kaiser, ; reichardt and kaiser, ; echols and green, ; castelazzi et al. , ). in this communication, we describe the isolation of a mutant defective in prm , the promoter for synthesis of c i- rex mrna in the presence of repressor (as in an established lysogen). the mutant, prm maps at a single site between the c i gene and r (the operator to which repressor binds to block rightward transcription of the λ x operon), is phenotypically c i − rex − , and yet complements the pre − mutant c y42 for lysogenization. thus, its existence precisely locates prm and provides a direct verification of some elements of the two-promoter hypothesis for c i- rex transcription. since prm does not appear to affect repressor binding at r , the two sites, prm and r , can be separated functionally by mutation.	biology
abstract the prehistory of the southern coast of brazil (santa catarina state) is materialized in the present landscape by numerous large-scale shellmounds, shellmounds with a sandy core, and fishmounds. a geoarchaeological approach was applied to understand the sequence and diversity of human actions involved in the settlement of the area as expressed in the multiple mounded structures, dated from the early holocene to shortly before the arrival of the first colonizers. a detailed account of the composition and history of four stratified shellmounds, two shellmounds with a sandy core, and two fishmounds is given using a standard method for intra and inter site comparisons. the method combines the macroscopic evaluation of the profiles with off-site sampling, provenance of the organic matter in the sediments, and micro-scale identification of components, their alteration, and arrangement. substantial implications result from this analysis related to the identification of recurrent behaviors in shellmound formation and growth, prehistoric alteration and destruction of habitation sites, development of a built environment, and continuity in mound building as an expression of group identity. shellmounds and fishmounds show a complex pre-depositional history that denies the traditional view of them as secondary deposits of food remains.	biology
ischemia-reperfusion (ir) injury is significantly worse in aged hearts, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. age-related damage to mitochondria may be a critical feature, which manifests in an exacerbation of ir injury. silent information regulator of transcription (sirt3), the major mitochondrial nad+-dependent lysine deacetylase, regulates a variety of functions, and its inhibition may disrupt mitochondrial function to impact recovery from ir injury. in this study, the role of sirt3 in mediating the response to cardiac ir injury was examined using an in vitro model of sirt3 knockdown (sirt3kd) in h9c2 cardiac-derived cells and in langendorff preparations from adult (7 mo old) wild-type (wt) and sirt3+/− hearts and aged (18 mo old) wt hearts. sirt3kd cells were more vulnerable to simulated ir injury and exhibited a 46% decrease in mitochondrial complex i (cx i) activity with low o2 consumption rates compared with controls. in the langendorff model, sirt3+/− adult hearts showed less functional recovery and greater infarct vs. wt, which recapitulates the in vitro results. in wt aged hearts, recovery from ir injury was similar to sirt3+/− adult hearts. mitochondrial protein acetylation was increased in both sirt3+/− adult and wt aged hearts (relative to wt adult), suggesting similar activities of sirt3. also, enzymatic activities of two sirt3 targets, cx i and mnsod, were similarly and significantly inhibited in sirt3+/− adult and wt aged cardiac mitochondria. in conclusion, decreased sirt3 may increase the susceptibility of cardiac-derived cells and adult hearts to ir injury and may contribute to a greater level of ir injury in the aged heart.	biology
gd3-synthase is one of the key sialyltransferases responsible for synthesis of ganglioside gd3, the substrate for initiation of the ‘b’ and ‘c’ series ganglioside synthesis. we have previously cloned the rat gd3-synthase gene promoter, and preliminary characterization has identified a minimal 0.5-kb region that has a strong basal promoter activity, and is gc-rich and has no caat or tata boxes. in this study, we showed that the sp1 and nf-κb sites in this region significantly contributed to basal gd3-synthase promoter activity. when either the sp1 or nf-κb sites were deleted, a 50% decrease in promoter activity was observed. the same results were obtained by a decoy strategy using oligonucleotides containing the sp1 or nf-κb sites. the binding to the sp1 and nf-κb sites was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (emsa), competition and supershift emsa. in addition, cell-type specific activation of the promoter was also determined. the promoter was highly activated in the gd3-expressing f-11 cells while repressed in ng-108 cells in which gd3 is almost undetectable. an additional band of nf-κb family was identified only in the f-11 nuclear extract using the nf-κb consensus probe by emsa. dna pull-down assays were further carried out to screen proteins that bound to the promoter including the basal region and the potential negative-regulatory region between −526 and −769. more than major binding proteins were pulled down, some of which were present only in the f-11 or ng-108 nuclear extracts. our data demonstrate that nf-κb and sp1 are the major determinants for the basal promoter activity and some factors such as nf-κb may be involved in cell type-specific expression of the gene.	biology
we investigated possible interactions between hiv-1 receptor (cd4) and the main coreceptors cxcr4 and ccr5. we found that cd4 and cxcr4 coexpressed in 293t cells form a complex that can be immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against the extracellular domain of either protein. mutagenesis revealed that the cd4/cxcr4 interaction maps to two previously uncharacterized basic motifs in the cytoplasmic domain of cd4. hiv-1 envelope glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion was found to be independent of the ability of cd4 and cxcr4 to interact, whether fusion was studied in a virus-cell or a cell-cell model. however, this interaction might explain the adaptation of hiv-1 to cxcr4 as an alternative to ccr5. we found that cxcr4 also interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of cd8alpha in a way that is similar to the cd4/cxcr4 interaction. the cd4/cxcr4 and cd8alpha/cxcr4 interactions may thus be involved in cellular signaling pathways shared by the cd4 and cd8alpha molecules.	biology
abstract a reca protein-generated triple-stranded dna species can be observed by electron microscopy, within narrowly defined conditions. three-stranded dna is detected only when initiation of normal dna strand exchange is precluded by heterologous sequences within the duplex dna substrate, when atp is hydrolyzed, and when the dna is cross-linked with a psoralen derivative prior to removal of reca filaments. when adenosine 5′-o-(thiotriphosphate) is used, only the product hybrid duplex dna can be cross-linked within the reca filament. the third strand is either displaced or interwound in a conformation that does not permit cross-linking. when atp is hydrolyzed by reca, all three strands are cross-linked within the filament in a complex pattern that suggests a dynamic structure. this structure is altered when reca protein is removed before cross-linking. hsieh et al.(1990) and rao et al.(1991, 1993) have proposed, on the basis of nuclease protection and chemical modification studies, that a stable triple-stranded dna species can persist after removal of reca protein. we have been unable to visualize these triple-stranded structures by the methods used in the present investigation. when reca removal was followed immediately by interstrand cross-linking, only the two strands of the hybrid duplex dna were cross-linked.	biology
summary spread of septoria nodorum from inoculated point sources was examined in pure stands and mixtures of two spring wheat cultivars kolibri and maris butler. gradients in disease were observed soon after inoculation; the presence of the more resistant cultivar (maris butler) in the mixtures retarded the outward spread of disease compared with the susceptible pure stand (kolibri). regression analysis suggested that gradients in incidence were influenced by nearness to the source whereas gradients in severity were not. spread of disease was also examined in pure stands and mixtures for the host/pathogen combinations, winter wheat (cvs maris huntsman and maris ranger)/s. nodorum and winter barley (cvs maris otter and hoppel)/rhynchosporium secalis. in contrast to the spring wheat experiment, no gradients were observed; explanations for the uniform distribution of disease were (a) extensive spread prior to the period of assessment, (b) no physical barrier to dispersal due to the juvenile growth stage of the crop and (c) exhaustion of the point-source.	biology

abstract the gene coding for bacillus subtilis rna polymerase major sigma rpod, was cloned together with its neighboring genes in a kb ecori fragment. the complete nucleotide sequence of a kb fragment including the entire rpod gene revealed the presence of two other genes preceding rpod in the order p23-dnae-rpod. the dnae codes for dna primase while the function of p23 remains unknown. the three genes reside in an operon that is similar in organization to the e. coli rna polymerase major sigma operon, which is composed of genes encoding small ribosome protein s21 (rpsu), dna primase (dnag), and rna polymerase sigma (rpod). there is a relatively high degree of base and amino acid homology between the dna primase and sigma genes. the most significant differences between the two operons are observed in the molecular size of the first genes (p23 and rpsu), the complete lack of amino acid homology between p23 and s21, the molecular weights of the two rpod genes, the size of the intercistronic region between the first two genes, and the regulatory elements of the operon.	biology
a five year field trial evaluated oilseed sunflower, helianthus annuus l., accessions, breeding lines, and interspecific crosses for resistance to infestation by naturally occurring populations of the banded sunflower moth, cochylis hospes walsingham (lepidoptera: tortricidae), in north dakota. germplasm with resistance to attack by the banded sunflower moth and subsequent larval feeding damage in the seeds was identified. pi had less than 10% feeding damage per head in all five years of testing and less than 6% in three of the five years. pi and pi exhibited 12% or less seed damage in three years of evaluation and pi had only 3% damage in two of the three years and was the least damaged in 2004. four other accessions (pi pi pi and pi 505651) revealed resistance in three of five years. a number of the interspecific crosses which were retested based on earlier results showed reduced seed damage in but subsequently exhibited much greater damage the following year due to higher populations of banded sunflower moth. hybrid was earlier used by others as a susceptible check; however, in the current investigation, this hybrid consistently had the lowest average seed damage from c. hospes feeding among the germplasm evaluated. results from this investigation indicate that there is potential for developing resistant genotypes with reduced feeding injury that will help sunflower producers reduce yield loss due to the banded sunflower moth. in addition, plant resistance can effectively be combined with delayed planting to decrease densities of c. hospes, thus reducing crop losses without disrupting the control of the larvae by parasitoids.	biology

abstract hemolymph juvenile hormone-binding protein (jhbp) is synthesized and secreted from fat body in the adult female cockroach, leucophaea maderae . the data in this paper suggest it is initially secreted from the fat body as a larger peptide whereas data in the accompanying paper demonstrate that jhbp is apolipophorin i. using media from cultures of fat body maintained in vitro , a jh-binding component was found that is jh iii saturable, has a k d of 1.5 × −8 m, binds jh iii > jh ii > jh i, and has a sedimentation value of 6.5s on high salt sucrose gradients. each of these properties is identical to those of the jhbp extracted from the hemolymph. to identify the protein that bound jh, media proteins were photoaffinity labeled with 10-[10,11- h]epoxyfarnesyl diazoacetate ([ h]efda). the results revealed that two media proteins bound [ h]efda in the absence of jh iii, but not in the presence of 100-fold excess jh iii. the molecular weights of the two media peptides were estimated by sds-page to be 275,000 and 220,000. to determine if the jhbp found in media of fat body cultures was due to hemolymph contamination of fat body, incorporation of [ h]leucine into newly synthesized and secreted fat body proteins during a h culture period was monitored. during the culture period, linear increases in the concentrations of radiolabeled and kd jhbp were observed. monoclonal antibodies specific for the kd hemolymph jhbp were found to recognize both the and kd jhbps in the media. to investigate the possibility that the kd protein is a precursor to the kd protein and that components of the hemolymph process or modify the precursor, hemolymph was introduced into fat body cultures and relative concentrations of the and kd media jhbps were determined. addition of hemolymph to these organ cultures resulted in an increase in the concentration of radiolabeled kd jhbp and a proportional decrease in the concentration of radiolabeled kd jhbp, suggesting that the kd protein is a precursor to the kd hemolymph jhbp. the mechanism of processing or modification remains undetermined.	biology

cumin (cuminum cyminum l.) is one of the most important pharmaceutical plants. as a considerable portion of existing agricultural lands in arid regions is exposed to aridity and finally to salinity, we need to study the effects of salinity on the growth and production of agronomical products. for this purpose, an agricultural experiment in the form of split plots with three replications was conducted in at the islamic azad university, gonabad branch, iran, in the longitude of 58°, 50', latitude of 34°, 54', and altitude of m from the sea level. at the main plot, four salinity levels (2,5,8 and 11ds/m) and at the sub plot, the growth stages of stress implementation (including stress in establishment, flowering, and seed filling stage), were located at random. the results showed that the salinity rate had significant impact on fresh weight, dry weight, height , percentage of essence, seed and biological yield. with the increase in salinity from to 11ds/m, a significant decrease in all vegetative and reproductive characteristics were observed. the most sensitive growth stages of plant to salt stress, during vegetative and reproductive period were the stage of establishment and flowering, respectively. there was no interaction between the growth stage of plant and salinity rate, except for seed yield and harvest index.	biology
"the biology of songbirds poses fundamental questions about the interplay between gene, brain, and behavior. new tools of genomic analysis will be invaluable in pursuing answers to these questions. this review begins with a summary of the broad properties of the songbird genome and how songbird brain gene expression has been measured in past studies. four key problems in songbird biology are then considered from a genomics perspective: what role does differential gene expression play in the development, maintenance, and functional organization of the song control circuit? does gene regulation set boundaries on the process of juvenile song learning? what is the purpose of song-induced gene activity in the adult brain? how does the genome underlie the profound sexual differentiation of the song control circuit? finally, the range of genomic technologies currently or soon to be available to songbird researchers is briefly reviewed. these technologies include online databases of expressed genes (""expressed sequence tags"" or ests); a complete library of the zebra finch genome maintained as a bacterial artificial chromosome (bac) library; dna microarrays for simultaneous measurement of many genes in a single experiment; and techniques for gene manipulation in the organism. collectively, these questions and techniques define the field of songbird neurogenomics."	biology

abstract the wavelength dependence of three different circadian responses to light was compared in syrian hamsters: phase advances and phase delays induced by 15-min light pulses at ctl8 (circadian time 18) and ctl3, respectively, and changes in free-running period under different levels of constant illumination (ll) intensity. fluorescent lamps with transmission maxima at and run were used for delivering blue, green, and red light, respectively. white fluorescent light was also used in the ll portion of the study. the magnitude of each circadian response was plotted as a function of light intensity expressed in photons cm −2 s −1 , and intensity-response relationships for the different wavelengths were quantified by fitting the data with a 4-parameter sigmoidal function using a least-squares curve-fitting routine. for each response type, the curves for the different wavelengths were identical but displaced along the horizontal axis (i.e., the functions differed only in the intensity (σ) required for producing a half-maximal response]. the values of a for green and blue light were similar, while that for red light was several times greater. these results indicate that a single class of photoreceptors with peak sensitivity in the blue-green region mediates light-induced phase advances, phase delays, and changes in the period of the hamster circadian pacemaker.	biology
nattokinase was produced by batch and fed-batch culture of bacillus subtilis in flask and fermentor. effect of supplementing complex media (peptone, yeast extract, or tryptone) was investigated on the production of nattokinase. in flask culture, the highest cell growth and nattokinase activity were obtained with g/l of peptone supplementation. in this condition, nattokinase activity was unit/ml at h. in batch culture of b. subtilis in fermentor, the highest nattokinase activity of unit/ml was obtained at h with g/l of peptone supplementation. from the batch kinetics data, it was shown that nattokinase production was growth-associated and culture should be harvested before stationary phase for maximum nattokinase production. in fed-batch culture of b. subtilis using ph-stat feeding strategy, cell growth (optical density monitored at nm) increased to ca. at h, which was 2.5 times higher than that in batch culture. the highest nattokinase activity was unit/ml at h, which was also 2.1 times higher than that in batch culture.	biology
human lymphocytes that have been heat-inactivated (1 hr, degrees c) were used as stimulator cells in a model system to study the requirements of allogeneic t cell activation in vitro. cytotoxic t lymphocytes were not generated in either primary or secondary mixed lymphocyte cultures after exposure to heated stimulator cells. successful reconstitution of cytolytic activity in primary cultures was achieved by the addition of ril-2. further, cytotoxic t cell lines could be maintained in culture for several weeks by stimulation with heated allogeneic cells and periodic addition of exogenous il-2. the cytotoxic t cells generated in primary cultures or in the t cell lines were specific for the hla class i antigens of the stimulating cells. thus, the combination of heated cells and il-2 stimulated antigen-specific cytotoxic cells, and not merely lymphokine-activated killers. although il-2 production appeared to be a crucial missing component of mlcs with heated lymphocytes, the addition of il-1, a factor known to act as a second signal for stimulating il-2 production, did not reconstitute cytolytic activity. these results indicate that (1) heat treatment does not appreciably affect class i structure; (2) hla class i/t cell receptor interactions are intact, resulting in responsiveness to il-2 but not il-1; and (3) heating creates a defect that has a minimal effect on ctl precursor activation but does disrupt a t helper cell/stimulator cell interaction critical for il-2 production.	biology
abstract the generality of age-related changes in concanavalin a (con a)-mediated red blood cell (rbc) adsorption to human diploid fibroblasts was investigated on fibroblast-like cells from fetal lung, heart, liver, skin and muscle tissues. all the cells examined showed the continuous increase from early passages in rbc adsorption with the rbc coating method (in which con a-coated rbcs are adsorbed to fibroblasts) and the increase only at phase iii with the fibroblast coating method (in which rbcs are adsorbed to con a-coated fibroblasts). all of the four strains of lung fibroblasts gave nearly the same extent of the age-related change in rbc adsorption, when expressed as a function of percentage life span consumed, indicating that the change in rbc adsorption is independent of genetic heterogeneity and the conditions of primary culture. liver and heart fibroblasts also gave results similar to those of lung fibroblasts. however, skin and muscle fibroblasts were lower in their rbc adsorption capacity throughout the life span. the continuous age-related increase in rbc adsorption to these cells could be sensitized by using glutaraldehyde-prefixed rbcs, trypsinized rbcs or phytohemagglutinin p in place of con a. the relevance of the phenotype of in vitro aging revealed by rbc adsorption to in vivo aging was also demonstrated on skin fibroblasts from different ages of donors using glutaraldehyde-prefixed rbcs. in addition, fibroblasts from patients with werner's syndrome, an hereditary disease manifested by early and widespread degenerative changes, showed senescent phenotype in rbc adsorption even at early passages.	biology
summary: the clarke-carbon colony bank containing colel-escherichia coli hybrid plasmids was screened by conjugation for complementation of the citrate synthase lesion of a glta mutant. three colel---glta+ plasmids were identified: plc26--17 (16·3 kilobase pairs), plc27--18 (16·35 kb) and plc31--28 (26·0 kb). the citrate synthase activities of strains containing the hybrid plasmids were amplified 3- to 10-fold. genetic studies indicated that the smaller plasmids may contain at least part of the succinate dehydrogenase gene (sdh). a physical map of a 19·4 kb region of the e. coli chromosome containing the citrate synthase gene (glta) was constructed by restriction analysis with the isolated plasmids. the relative positions of restriction sites were defined and a region (3·1 kb) containing the glta+ gene was identified in the segment common to all three plasmids.	biology
background mssps, mycsingle strand binding proteins, were originally identified as proteins recognizing a putative replication origin/transcriptional enhancer in the human c-myc gene. the cdnas encoding four of the family proteins, mssp-1, mssp-2, scr2 and scr3, were cloned. these proteins carry two copies of the putative rna binding domains, rnp-a and rnp-b, and have been suggested to participate in dna replication and cell cycle progression from the g1 to the s phase. results we report that mssp-1 and mssp-2 bound directly to the c-terminal portion of c-myc, along with max, side by side. mssp, c-myc and max formed a ternary complex in vivo, although mssp did not directly associate with max. the mssp/myc/max ternary complex lost the binding activity to the e-box sequence—the recognition sequence of c-myc/max complex—thereby abrogating the e-box-dependent transcription activity of c-myc. mssp specifically stimulated the cooperative transforming activity of c-myc with ras, in a manner dependent upon the rnp sequences, while mssp itself showed no transforming activity in mouse nih3t3 cells. the nih3t3 transformants, together with ras, myc and mssp, grew to form very large colonies in soft agar, as compared to those with ras plus myc or ras alone. conclusions mssp is a modulator of c-myc and the c-myc/mssp complex may deregulate cell cycle controls and lead cells towards transforming pathways.	biology
abstract five mature ileorectal anastomosed blue foxes (6.18±0.15 kg) were used in digestibility experiments to evaluate the l-carnitine apparent ileal absorption from diets used in reproductive polar fox nutrition over the year-long farm-feeding period on two domestic farms (a and b) differing in reproduction results. the concentration of l-carnitine was higher in diets from farm b (136.1–241.7 mg kg−1 dm) than in the diets from farm a (88.5–135.2 mg kg−1 dm). the coefficients of ileal apparent absorption of l-carnitine ranged from 60.23 to 75.57% for diets a (farm a) composed mainly of fish and poultry offals. the coefficients of ileal apparent digestibility of l-carnitine were higher for diets b (farm b) (83.75–94.78%; p<0.05) based on beef offals. these data indicate high concentration and efficient ileal apparent absorption of l-carnitine from diets used in reproductive polar fox nutrition on both farms examined.	biology
the recombinant plasmid dpta1 has an insert of relic wheat dna that represents a family of tandemly organized dna sequences with a monomeric length of approximately bp. this insert was used to investigate the structural organization of this element in the genomes of species within the tribe triticeae and in species representing other tribes of the poaceae. the main characteristic of the genomic organization of dpta1 is a classical ladder-type pattern which is typical for tandemly organized sequences. the dpta1 sequence is present in all of the genomes of the triticeae species examined and in species from a closely related tribe (bromus inermis, bromeae). dna from hordelymus europaeus (triticeae) did not hybridize under the standard conditions used in this study. prolonged exposure was necessary to obtain a weak signal. our data suggest that the dpta1 family is quite old in evolutionary terms, probably more ancient than the tribe triticeae. the dpta1 sequence is more abundant in the d-genome of wheat than in other genomes in triticeae. dna from several species also have bands in addition to the tandem repeats. the dpta1 sequence contains short direct and inverted subrepeats and is homologous to a tandemly repeated dna sequence from hordeum chilense.	biology
leukotrienes (lts) are potent mediators of bronchial inflammation and are predominantly produced by myeloid cells. as myelocytic cells differentiate towards either eosinophils or neutrophils, the profile of leukotrienes they produce upon stimulation diverges. eosinophils produce mainly cysteinyl leukotrienes whereas neutrophils predominantly synthesize 5(s),12(r)-dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (ltb4). the mechanism by which this change in leukotriene composition occurs is unknown. in this study, we investigated the control of leukotriene biosynthetic enzymes during myeloid cell differentiation. western-blot analyses of myelocytic leukemia cell lines, hl-60#7 and hl-60, differentiated towards eosinophilic or neutrophilic cell types, respectively, demonstrated that as myelocytic cells differentiate towards eosinophils or neutrophils, the protein levels of cytosolic phospholipase a2 (cpla2) remain constant, whereas 5-lipoxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (flap) levels are simultaneously elevated. as myelocytic cells become more eosinophil-like, 5(s)-hydroxy-6(r)-s -glutathionyl-7,9-trans-11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid (ltc4) synthase activity and expression of both the protein and messenger rna in the cells are dramatically increased (approximately 75-fold), while the ltc4 synthase level and activity in neutrophil-like cells remain constant at very low levels. in contrast, in neutrophilic cells, the amount of 5,6-oxido-7,9,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (lta4) hydrolase was elevated approximately 100-fold greater than the increase in lta4 hydrolase from eosinophilic cells. these results indicate that as a myeloid cell differentiates towards a granulocyte, similar mechanisms of regulation may be applied to the leukotriene biosynthetic pathway up to the point at which the pathway diverges. at the stage in the leukotriene biosynthetic pathway where lta4 may be converted to either ltc4 or to ltb4, specific regulators of transcription may become activated as a myelocytic cell differentiates, thereby causing increased lta4 hydrolase or ltc4 synthase expression.	biology
in wild and cultivated annual plant species, flowering time is an important life-history trait that coordinates the life cycle with local environmental conditions. extensive studies on the genetic basis of flowering time in the model species arabidopsis thaliana have revealed a complex genetic network that can detect environmental and internal signals. based on this knowledge and on known pleiotropic effects associated with flowering time genes, we suggest that a natural shift towards an early-flowering life cycle might involve only particular functional regions in a limited number of genes. our predictions are supported by genetic theories of adaptation and by recent data about genes associated with natural variation. we analyse the extent to which these predictions can also apply to crop species.	biology
after two-thirds hepatectomy, normally quiescent liver cells are stimulated to reenter the cell cycle and proliferate to restore the original liver mass. the level of bzip transcription factor ccaat enhancer-binding protein beta (c/ebpbeta) increases in the liver during the period of cell proliferation. the significance of this change in c/ebp expression is not understood. to determine the role of c/ebpbeta in the regenerating liver, we examined the regenerative response after partial hepatectomy in mice that contain a targeted disruption of the c/ebpbeta gene. posthepatectomy, hepatocyte dna synthesis was decreased to 25% of normal in c/ebpbeta -/- mice. the reduced regenerative response was associated with a prolonged period of hypoglycemia that was independent of expression of c/ebpalpha protein and gluconeogenic genes. c/ebpbeta -/- livers showed reduced expression of immediate-early growth-control genes including the egr-1 transcription factor, mitogen-activated protein kinase protein tyrosine phosphatase (mkp-1), and hrs, a delayed-early gene that encodes an mrna splicing protein. cyclin b and e gene expression were dramatically reduced in c/ebpbeta -/- livers whereas cyclin d1 expression was normal. the abnormalities in immediate-early gene expression in c/ebpbeta -/- livers were distinct from those seen in il-6 -/- livers. these data link c/ebpbeta to the activation of metabolic and growth response pathways in the regenerating liver and demonstrate that c/ebpbeta is required for a normal proliferative response.	biology
four species of biuterina fuhrmann, (cestoda, cyclophyllidea, paruterinidae), originally described from afrotropical passeriform birds, are redescribed and figured on the basis of their type-specimens. these are b. pentamyzos (mettrick, 1960) from prionops plumata (laniidae) in zimbabwe, b. quelea (mettrick, 1963) from quelea quelea (ploceidae) in zimbabwe, b. ugandae baylis, from chalcomitra senegalensis (nectariniidae) in uganda and b. zambiensis (mettrick, 1960) from campephaga flava (campephagidae) in zimbabwe. the rostellum of b. quelea is a spherical structure filled with strongly-developed glandular tissue and possessing a weak musculature. the remaining three species have a sucker-like rostellar apparatus with moderately developed glandular tissue in the rostellum and around it. it is considered that the glandular elements are an inherent part of the rostellar apparatus of the paruterinids. an armament consisting of fine, punctiform, spine-like structures arranged in transverse rows on the inner surface of suckers is observed in b. pentamyzos. this is the first record of sucker armature in the paruterinidae.	biology
chick embryo cells infected with an influenza a (fowl plague) virus have been labelled with (3h)-uridine for different lengths of time. virion rna and cellular rna have been separated by specific hybridization with a surplus of unlabelled viral complementary rna and rnase digestion. the ratio of the specific radioacticity in the ump and cmp moieties of both types of rna has been determined. since the rate of approach to equilibrium of cmp to ump labelling of both types of rna is completely different it is concluded that cellular and virion rna are synthesized using different pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphate pools.	biology
to evaluate mercury (hg) exposure and possible adverse effects of hg on american dipper (cinclus mexicanus) reproduction, we collected eggs and nestling feathers and the larval/nymph form of three orders of aquatic macroinvertebrates (ephemeroptera, plecoptera and trichoptera = ept) important in their diet from three major headwater tributaries of the upper willamette river, oregon in 2002. the coast fork willamette river is contaminated with hg due to historical cinnabar (hgs) mining at the black butte mine; the row river is affected by past gold-mining operations located within the bohemia mining district, where hg was used in the amalgamation process to recover gold; and the middle fork willamette river is the reference area with no known mining. methyl mercury (mehg) concentrations (geometric mean) in composite ept larvae (111.9 ng/g dry weight [dw] or 19.8 ng/g wet weight [ww]), dipper eggs (38.5 ng/g ww) and nestling feathers (1158 ng/g ww) collected from the coast fork willamette were significantly higher than mehg concentrations in ept and dipper samples from other streams. total mercury (thg) concentrations in surface sediments along the same hg-impacted streams were investigated by others in (row river tributaries) and (coast fork). the reported sediment thg concentrations paralleled our biological findings. dipper breeding territories at higher elevations had fewer second clutches; however, dipper reproductive success along all streams (including the lower elevation and most hg-contaminated coast fork), was judged excellent compared to other studies reviewed. furthermore, mehg concentrations in ept samples from this study were well below dietary concentrations in other aquatic bird species, such as loons and ducks, reported to cause hg-related reproductive problems. our data suggest that either dipper feathers or ept composites used to project mehg concentrations in dipper feathers (with biomagnification factor of 10–20×) may be used, but with caution, to screen headwater streams for potential hg-related effects on dippers. when actual feather concentrations or projected feather concentrations are equal to or lower than concentrations reported for the coast fork, dippers are expected to reproduce well (assuming adequate prey and suitable nest sites). when hg concentrations are substantially higher, more detailed investigations may be required. birds feeding almost exclusively on fish (e.g., osprey [pandion haliaetus]) and usually found further downstream from the headwaters would not be adequately represented by dippers given the higher mehg concentrations in fish resulting from biomagnification, compared to lower trophic level invertebrates.	biology
the bacterial cyclic nucleotide gated (bcng) ion channel family contains a n-terminal channel domain, which is homologous to the mechanosensitive channel of small conductance (mscs) and a ligand binding domain with sequence similarity to known cyclic nucleotide binding domains. previously, we have demonstrated that some of these channels gate in response to cyclic adenosine monophosphate alone [caldwell, et al, bba 1750-1756]. here we explore the ability of bcng channels to gate in response to mechanical stress, which one might predict based on their significant sequence homology to mscs. to this end, we measured the ability of fourteen distinct bcng channels from several different bacterial strains to rescue e. coli lacking mechanosensitive channels (mscs/mscl/msck null) from osmotic downshock. in our studies, only two bcng channels exhibit limited ability to rescue bacteria from osmotic downshock. these two channels were found in bacterial strains with genomes encoding for multiple variants of the bcng gene. only one bcng channel variant in each strain was capable of rescuing e.coli from osmotic downshock, implying that each gene product may have a unique role or that the two gene products may work in concert. additionally, truncation of the cyclic nucleotide binding domain in some non-mechanosensitive variants of bcng increases their response to mechanical stress.	biology
"retroviruses have evolved effective strategies to evade the host immune response, such as high variability and latent infection. in addition, primate lentiviruses, such as hiv-1, have acquired several «accessory» genes that antagonize antiviral host restriction factors and facilitate viral immune evasion, thereby allowing continuous and efficient viral replication despite apparently strong innate and acquired immune responses. here, i summarize some of our current knowledge on the function of the viral vpu and nef genes, with a particular focus on their capability to antagonize an antiviral factor named ""tetherin"" (bst-2) that tethers nascent virions at the cell surface. evidence will be presented that switches between nef- and vpu-mediated tetherin antagonism preceded the emergence of hiv-1. furthermore, it will be discussed why tetherin most likely poses a significant hurdle to cross-species transmissions of simian immunodeficiency viruses to humans. to our current knowledge only pandemic hiv-1 m (major) strains mastered this barrier perfectly by,,regaining"" efficient tetherin activity by vpu following the four independent cross-species transmissions that resulted in hiv-1 groups m, o, n, and p. this may potentially explain why hiv-1 m it is almost entirely responsible for the hiv/aids pandemic."	biology
abstract breeding experiments with rattus rattus indicate that the inheritance of resistance to the rodenticide warfarin has a multifactorial basis. in resistant × resistant and resistant × susceptible crosses between wild-caught rats, averages of and 17% respectively of the offspring were resistant. in f backcrosses to the susceptible, less than 1% were resistant. susceptible rats bred true. significant inter-family variation was observed in resistant crosses. the implications of the results for the development and containment of resistant populations in the field are discussed.	biology
bone morphogenetic protein-7 (bmp-7), a member of the transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta superfamily of signaling cytokines, induces dendritic growth in rat sympathetic neurons. in this study, we present evidence that the recently discovered integrative nuclear fgfr1 signaling (infs) pathway is involved in dendrite outgrowth mediated by bmp-7. immunocytochemical analysis of expressed fibroblast growth factors (fgfs) showed that little fgf-2 was detected in control neurons, but the expression of this molecule in the cytoplasm and nucleus increased within h after bmp-7 treatment. in contrast, fgf-1 was constitutively present in the peripheral cytoplasm and in neurites under control conditions, and its distribution did not change with bmp-7 exposure. the high-affinity receptor fgfr1 was present in low amounts in control neurons and was associated with the cytoplasm, the plasma membrane, and the nucleus. twenty-four hours of bmp-7 treatment elicited an increase in fgfr1 nuclear localization. overexpressed constructs of fgfr1 that lack the tyrosine kinase domain, and have been shown to act in a dominant-negative manner on fgfr1 signaling, inhibited bmp-7 mediated initial dendrite outgrowth in transfected neurons by approximately 50%. however, targeted inhibition of extracellular fgf-2 by overexpression of a secreted receptor mutant fgfr1(tm-) lacking the transmembrane domain failed to affect bmp-7 induced dendritic growth, as did treatment with the extracellular fgfr antagonist inositol hexakisphosphate. these results suggest that the infs, which has already been implicated in a broad range of activities in other cell types, may also be required for bmp-7 to stimulate dendritic development.	biology
abstract odour emanating from anaerobic lagoons and swine production facilities has increased the tension among rural neighbors and among urban and rural residents. storage of swine manure is associated with the production of a variety of odorous compounds, including ammonia, organic acids and alcohols, and sulphides. although the generation of these chemicals is the result of microbiological activity, little is known about the types of microorganisms responsible for their production. we have initiated an approach to determine and compare the bacterial populations present in both pig faeces and manure storage pits. total dna was isolated from both of these ecosystems. dna sequence analyses of pcr amplified 16s rdna genes derived from eubacterial sequences were carried out. similarity analyses of the 16s sequences indicated the presence of primarily low g + c gram-positive bacteria, such as clostridium sp., streptococcus sp., and lactobacillus sp. in both ecosystems. many of the sequences were from unidentified microorganisms. these results indicate that the primary eubacteria identified in swine faeces and manure pits are low g + c, gram-positive bacteria.	biology
a longitudinal study to identify the species of liriomyza leafminer, their distribution, relative abundance, and seasonal variation, including their host range, was conducted in vegetable fields at three altitudes in kenya from november to november 2012. three main species were identified: liriomyza huidobrensis (blanchard), liriomyza sativae blanchard, and liriomyza trifolii (burgess), of which l. huidobrensis was the most abundant across all altitudes irrespective of the cropping season and accounting for over 90% of the total liriomyza specimens collected. liriomyza species were collected from all infested incubated leaves of crops surveyed belonging to seven families: fabaceae, solanaceae, cucurbitaceae, malvaceae, brassicaceae, amaranthaceae, and amaryllidaceae. however, more than 87.5% of the liriomyza species were obtained from only four of these crops: pisum sativum l., phaseolus vulgaris l., solanum lycopersicum l., and solanum tuberosum, thereby demonstrating that fabaceae and solonaceae crops are the most important hosts with regard to liriomyza species richness and relative abundance. l. huidobrensis had the widest host range (20 crops), followed by l. sativae (18 crops) and l. trifolii (12 crops). although l. trifolii has been considered the dominant liriomyza leafminer in kenya, this study suggests that this may not be the case anymore, as l. huidobrensis dominates at all altitudes.	biology
abstractthe present work deals with hormonal regulation of growth and antheridial formation in male clones in three dioecious mosses, barbula gregaria (mitt.) jaeg., bryum coronatum schwaegr. and philonotis turneriana schwaegr. (mitt.). barbula and bryum develop antheridia in ordinary cultural conditions on basal medium, whereas philonotis remains sterile. of the three phytohormones tested, iaa increases antheridial production as well as the number of gametophores in bryum and barbula, but its effect on antheridial formation is more striking. ga3 enhances antheridial induction and vegetative growth in the three mosses. its effect on antheridial induction is more striking in philonotis than in barbula and bryum. kinetin is more effective in enhancing the number of gametophores than antheridial formation in barbula and bryum. the two animal sex hormones, progesterone and testosterone, enhance antheridial production as well as the formation of gametophores. except for ga3 none of the hormones tested induces ...	biology
dermatophytoses caused by the genus microsporum require a long-duration therapy compared to infections caused by other genera. treatment of these cutaneous infections includes topical and systemic antifungal agents. tinea capitis and tinea unguium caused by m. canis and m. gypseum are the most difficult-to-treat dermatophytoses. there are few specific studies about corresponding antifungal susceptibility in vitro. recently, the clinical and laboratory standards institute proposed the m38a document as standard to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of several antifungal agents against conidium-forming filamentous fungi; however, dermatophytes were not included in this document. this study aimed to contribute to continuing investigations concerning the optimal antifungal susceptibility testing conditions of microsporum spp. to terbinafine, ciclopiroxolamine and griseofulvin. the results pointed out potato dextrose agar as the best culture medium for inducing conidia sporulation, inoculum density amounting to x 10(3) conidia ml(-1), containing only microconidia, with an incubation time of days at degrees c and 100% growth inhibition serving as an endpoint. the minimum fungicidal concentration values were in accordance with the mics values, showing a fungicidal activity of these drugs towards the tested strains. according to our results, in general, terbinafine was more active than griseofulvin and ciclopiroxolamine.	biology
"we have shown previously that pigment epithelium-derived factor (pedf) acts as a survival factor for cerebellar granule cell neurons in culture, as well as protecting them against glutamate toxicity. in this study we have examined effects of pedf on apoptotic cell death. we find that the granule cells die of apoptosis throughout the culture period, what we have termed ""natural"" apoptosis. pedf prevents this natural apoptosis if added to immature cells, within the first days in vitro (div), and the effect is maintained for up to div12. however, pedf has no effect if added to mature cells at div5. similar results are obtained when apoptosis is induced by shifting the cells from a serum- and mm kcl-containing medium to serum-free medium with mm kcl. pedf most effectively blocks induced apoptosis in immature cells (div2) when added hr prior to the change of medium, but still provides some protection when added simultaneously. however, hr pretreatment with pedf has a minimal effect when apoptosis is induced in mature div6 cells; addition at the same time is completely ineffective. two polypeptide fragments of pedf, only one of which contains the serine-protease inhibitory site, are equally active, supporting previous results which suggest that the neurotrophic effects of pedf are not mediated by protease inhibition. we conclude that pedf protects immature but not mature granule cells against both natural and induced apoptosis."	biology
a new isolate of rice tungro bacilliform virus (rtbv) was collected from chinsura, west bengal, india. the full genome was sequenced and deposited to genbank designating the new one as chinsura isolate. the four open reading frames (orfs) of the new isolate were compared with those of previously reported ‘south-east asian’ (sea) and ‘south asian’ (sa) isolates emphasizing the orf3, which is the largest and functionally most important gene of rtbv. in the orfs, chinsura isolate shared 90.0–100.0% identity at amino acid level with sa isolates, but only 58.76–88.63% identity with sea isolates for the same. similarly, the amino acid identity of orfs between sea and sa isolates ranged from 58.77 to 88.64, whereas within each group the corresponding value was >96.0%. the phylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide and amino acid sequences of each orf made two broad clusters of sea- and sa-types including chinsura isolate within sa cluster. moreover, the relative positions and length of functional domains corresponding to movement protein (mp), coat protein (cp), aspartate protease (pr) and reverse transcriptase/ribonuclease h (rt/rnase h) of orf3 of chinsura isolate were completely identical with sa isolates. the clustering pattern indicated strong influence of geographical habitat on genomic evolution. comparison of orf3 among all the isolates revealed major variations at non-functional regions in between the functional domains and at the hypervariable 3′-terminal end of orf3, while pr appeared to have evolved differentially in sa isolates expecting further characterization.	biology
the phragmoplast is a special apparatus that functions in establishing a cell plate in dividing plant cells. it is known that microfilaments (mfs) are involved in constituting phragmoplast structure, but the dynamic distribution and role of phragmoplast mfs are far from being understood. in this study, the precise structure and dynamics of mfs during the initiation and the late lateral expansion of the phragmoplast were observed by using a tobacco by-2 cell line stably expressing the microfilament reporter construct gfp-fabd2. three-dimensional imaging showed that the phragmoplast mfs were initiated by two populations of mfs emerging between the reconstituting daughter nuclei at anaphase, which migrated to the mid-zone and gave rise to two layers of microfilament arrays. fm4-64 stained vesicles accumulated and fused with the cell plate between the two populations of mfs. the two layers of microfilament arrays of phragmoplast with ends overlapped always surrounded the centrifugally expanding cell plate. partial disruption of mfs at metaphase by low concentration of latrunculin b resulted in the inhibition of the cell plate consolidation and the blockage of cell plate lateral expansion, whereas high concentration of latrunculin b restrained the progression of the cell cycle. treating the cell after the initiation of phragmoplast led to the cease of the expansion of the cell plate. our observations provide new insights into the precise structure and dynamics of phragmoplast mfs during cytokinesis and suggest that dynamic phragmoplast mfs are important in cell plate formation.	biology
the enteric nervous system (ens) has been explored by developmental neurobiologists and medical researchers for decades. whereas developmental biologists have been unravelling the molecular mechanisms underlying the migration, proliferation and differentiation of the neural crest derivatives that give rise to the ens, human geneticists have been uncovering the genetic basis for diseases of the ens, notably hirschsprung's disease. here we discuss the exciting recent advances, including novel transgenic and genetic tools, a broadening range of model organisms, and the pursuit of ens stem cells as a therapeutic tool, that are bringing these fields closer together.	biology
in this work, we evaluated the capacity of a fungal transfer rna (f-trna) from aspergillus niger to protect hep-2 cells against a viral infection, and as an inducer of ifn-beta synthesis. hep-2 cells previously incubated with f-trna, polyi:polyc, or ifn-alpha, at different concentrations for h were infected with pfu of adenovirus type (adv-6); after days, we determined cellular viability, cytopathic effect of the virus, optimal concentration necessary to inhibit the cytopathic effect, and ifn-beta expression by rt-pcr. results showed that hep-2 cells treated with f-trna were less susceptible to the cytopathic effect of adv-6 infection than those incubated with polyi:polyc (p < 0.05). on the other hand, f-trna- treated hep-2 cells expressed ifn-beta mrna, whereas monolayers incubated with polyi:polyc or ifn-alpha did not. our results suggest that f-trna protected hep-2 cells against adv-6 infection, due to its capacity to induce ifn-beta synthesis.	biology
repair of dna double-strand breaks by homologous recombination requires an extensive set of proteins. among these proteins are rad51 and mre11, which are known to re-localize to sites of dna damage into nuclear foci. ionizing radiation-induced foci can be visualized by immuno-staining. published data show a large variation in the number of foci-positive cells and number of foci per nucleus for specific dna repair proteins. the experiments described here demonstrate that the time after induction of dna damage influenced not only the number of foci-positive cells, but also the size of the individual foci. the dose of ionizing radiation influenced both the number of foci-positive cells and the number of foci per nucleus. furthermore, ionizing radiation-induced foci formation depended on the cell cycle stage of the cells and the protein of interest that was investigated. rad51 and mre11 foci seemed to be mutually exclusive, though a small subset of cells did show co-localization of these proteins, which suggests a possible cooperation between the proteins at a specific moment during dna repair.	biology
long interspersed nuclear elements (l1 elements or line1) are the most active autonomous retrotransposons in mammalian genomes. in addition to l1 elements themselves, other protein-coding mrnas can also be reverse transcribed and integrated into the genome through the l1-mediated retrotransposition, leading to the formation of processed pseudogenes (pps) and retrogenes, both of which are characterized by the lack of introns and the presence of a 3' polya tract and flanking direct repeats. pps are unable to encode a functional protein and have accumulated frameshift mutations and premature stop codons during evolution. a few of pps are transcriptionally active. retrogenes preserve undisrupted coding frames and are capable of encoding a functional protein that is identical or nearly identical to that of the progenitor gene. there is a significant excess of retrogenes that originate from the x chromosome and are retrotransposed into autosomes, and most of these retrogenes are specially expressed in male germ cells, suggesting the inactivation of x-linked genes during male meiosis provides a strong selection pressure on retrogenes originating from the x chromosome.	biology
the effect of a lack of the gene encoding monoamine oxidase a (mao a) in transgenic tg8 mice on the activity of tryptophan hydroxylase (tph), the rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin (5-ht) biosynthesis, and on the levels of 5-ht and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-hiaa) in the midbrain, hypothalamus, hippocampus, striatum, amygdala, and frontal cortex was studied. it was shown that mice with a genetic mao a knockout differed from mice of the initial c3h/hej strain in having a higher level of 5-ht and a lower level of its metabolite, 5-hiaa, in all brain regions but the frontal cortex, where the changes were insignificant. although the 5-hiaa/5-ht ratio in various brain regions differed considerably, the decrease of the 5-ht oxidative deamination index in tg8 mice was similar in different brain regions (to 41-45% of control values), with the exception of the frontal cortex, where the decrease of the 5-hiaa/5-ht was somewhat smaller (to 54%). the presence of the remaining 45% +/- 1.9% of the control ratio value indicates rather effective oxidative deamination of 5-ht in mao a knockout mice and explains the lack of severe behavioral and pathological consequences in mao a genetic deficiency. an increase of tph activity in mice lacking mao a was found in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. no significant changes were found in the striatum, hypothalamus, and midbrain. the data show an effect of the mao a gene mutation on tph and indicate a uniform decrease of 5-ht catabolism in different brain regions except for the frontal cortex, which is somewhat more resistant to the lack of mao a than other brain structures.	biology
the aim of this study was to investigate causes of the short estrous cycles that occur frequently in dairy cows after estrus synchronization using pgf2α and gnrh. expression of oxytocin receptor (or), progesterone receptor (pr), and estrogen receptor (er); of cyclo-oxygenase ii (cox-ii) and 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20α-hsd); and of peripheral blood estradiol-17s and progesterone (p4) concentrations were analyzed in estrous cycles of normal length and in induced short estrous cycles. on day (ovulation = day 0), presynchronized dairy cows (n = 14) were given 0.15 mg of dexcloprostenol and 0.1 mg of gonadorelin hours later. animals were bled once daily for p4 and estradiol-17s analyses, and endometrial biopsy specimens were taken on days and for pr, er, or, 20α-hsd, and cox-ii determinations with immunohistochemistry and/or real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr). ovulations and ovarian structures were monitored with transrectal ultrasound daily until the next ovulation. after excluding one case of incomplete luteal regression, short estrous cycles occurred in of cases (length from to days). no differences were established in endometrial er, pr, or cox-ii expression between the normal and short cycle groups in the semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry analysis. in qrt-pcr analysis, no differences were found in relative gene expression of endometrial er, pr, or, 20α-hsd, or cox-ii between normal and short cycles. despite evidence from previous studies that short estrous cycles are induced by premature prostaglandin release, differences in these receptors or in enzyme expression do not explain the release.	biology
summary the inconsistency in lotka's stable population model (two different intrinsic growth rates for the two sexes) arises from the fact that he considers two equations (for male and female births), and not because his equation for one sex does not involve the other. many authors in the past have erroneously put emphasis on the latter point and modified lotka's equations for male and female births. since sex ratio at birth is constant, two independent equations for male and female births cannot exist. the correct approach is to attempt to form an equation for all births. the author followed this approach in his earlier works on the problem, but his birth functions were formulated from axiomatic considerations. the present paper provides a new birth function which has an intuitively appealing physical interpretation, and for which the interaction between the sexes is empirically determined from the data.	biology
during ovarian maturation in the crayfish cherax quadricarinatus, changes in ovarian protein kinase c (pkc) isoenzymes take place in parallel to yolk accumulation (as shown by immunoblot analysis). significant changes were recorded in the amounts of specific isoenzymes and in their distribution between the cytosol and the membranes. ovarian maturation was accompanied by the appearance of high- and low-molecular-weight immunoreactive pkc isoenzyme species. among the isoenzymes tested, pkc a was the most clearly activated during ovarian maturation, as shown by significant translocation from the cytosol to the particulate fraction and the appearance of high-molecular-weight species. moreover, a similar picture was obtained in the ovaries of intersex individuals upon induction of secondary vitellogenesis by androgenic gland ablation. immunohistological staining showed pkc a to be localized mainly in the cytosol of premature oocytes, whereas in later maturation stages, it was concentrated around the nucleus in a vesicular structure and in the oocyte membrane. in secondary vitellogenic stages, pkc was localized in the plasma membrane and apparently in follicular cells. in addition, its activity was demonstrated by in vitro phosphorylation assays of a crayfish ovarian homogenate. activation of total pkc phosphorylation of histone, an external substrate, was induced by phosphatidylserine plus 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (tpa) or methyl farnesoate. both tpa and methyl farnesoate stimulated activation of pkc a in organ culture, causing its translocation from the cytosol to the membranes and inducing autophosphorylation of threonine residues. the changes in pkc isoenzymes during ovarian maturation in the crayfish suggest their involvement in this process as well as a possible regulatory role for methyl farnesoate through a direct effect on some pkc isoenzymes. © academic press	biology
a study of the development of the sense organs of the larva of botryllus schlosseri to determine, if possible, any homologies between its sense organs and those of other types of ascidians such as molgula and ammaroucium, which have sense organs structurally very different. the statolith appears in the botryllus embryo as a single club-shaped cell. the lightsensitive organs have their primordia slightly later as five small filaments, each developed from a ganglion cell. a cavity appears in the statolith into which the light-sensitive filaments penetrate. later development is concerned with pigmentation of the statolith, and a twisting process which orients it into the position in which it is found in the free-swimming larva. the three tactile papillae develop from evaginations of ectoderm at the anterior end of the embryo. the ectodermal cells at the center of a papilla are differentiated into rod-shaped sensory receptors and ganglion-like masses of nerve tissue. nervous connections are established between these peripheral ganglia and the central nervous system. results of the investigation indicate that the statoliths of the different ascidian larvae are homologous; the direction eyes probably are not, but have evolved independently from a light-sensitive area in the primitive larva of a common ancestral ascidian. the larvae of molgula and ammaroucium possess no structures comparable to the sensory papillae of botryllus.	biology
the physiological decline that occurs with aging is thought to result, in part, from accumulation of oxidative damage produced by reactive oxygen species (ros) generated during normal metabolism. two genetic mouse models of aging, the ames dwarf and growth hormone (gh) transgenic, suggest that hormone levels may play a role in antioxidative defense and aging. to explore this possibility, catalase (cat), an enzyme involved in elimination of ros, was evaluated in long-lived dwarf and short-lived transgenic mice. catalase activity and/or protein was significantly elevated in livers from dwarf mice at 13-15, and months of age when compared to age-matched wild type mice. in contrast, a and 38% reduction (p < 0.05) in cat protein was observed in and to month old gh transgenics respectively, when compared to wild type mice. kidneys from old dwarf mice exhibited significantly increased cat activity (22%), protein (16%) and mrna expression (59%) compared to wild type mice. conversely, kidneys from gh transgenic mice showed reductions in cat activity. the results of this study suggest that hormonal status modulates antioxidative mechanisms and that cat is important in overall defense capacity with respect to lifespan in both decelerated (dwarf) and accelerated (transgenic) mammalian models of aging.	biology
abstract experiments were carried out to evaluate two systems: (1) premunition and (2) chemoprophylaxis for the control of bovine babesiosis and anaplasmosis in the cauca river valley, colombia. control of these diseases was achieved by inoculating cattle with virulent babesia bigemina, babesia argentina , and anaplasma marginale and subsequent treatment with imidocarb and gloxazone to moderate the postpremunition reactions. chemoprophylactic treatment with imidocarb and gloxazone was administered to cattle before and during field exposure. premunized cattle were highly resistant to tick-borne ( boophilus microplus ) challenge. imidocarb had therapeutic and chemoprophylactic properties against babesiosis, but appeared toxic. gloxazone moderated the a. marginale postpremunition reaction, but failed to prevent clinical anaplasmosis under the conditions of this investigation.	biology
the association of class i and ii hla antigens with rheumatic fever and its manifestations was examined in patients, including blacks and caucasians. no significant association was found between class i antigens and rheumatic fever. in contrast, hla-dr2 and hla-dr4 phenotypes were encountered in a significantly higher frequency in black and caucasian patients with rheumatic fever, respectively, compared with the control populations (p less than 0.005). the most significant association (p less than 0.005) of these dr antigens with a major manifestation of rheumatic fever was found for mitral insufficiency. in addition, a significant association was encountered between persistent elevation of antibody to the group a streptococcal carbohydrate and hla-dr4 in caucasian patients (p less than 0.04) or hla-dr2 in the black patients (p less than 0.001). the frequency of hla-dr2/4 heterozygotes among patients with rheumatic fever did not differ significantly from controls. these findings support the concept of a genetically determined susceptibility to rheumatic fever and, particularly, to rheumatic heart disease. the association of the clinical manifestations of rheumatic fever and the immune hyperresponsiveness to a streptococcal antigen could be ascribed to a disease-associated immune-response gene which is in linkage disequilibrium with the dr2 and dr4 alleles of hla-dr locus on chromosome six.	biology
chlamydial infections of the genital organs cause reproductive failure in female pigs, and the uterus is recognized a target tissue for an infection. in contrast, information on the effect of chlamydiae on the porcine oviduct is patchily and inconclusive, although the bacteria are known to cause severe tubal defects in humans and laboratory animals. the aim of this study was to examine the segments ampulla (a), isthmus (i) and utero-tubal junction of the left (n = 20) or both (n = 22) oviducts, and uteri (u) from culled repeat breeder pigs for chlamydiae using ompa-pcr, partial ompa gene sequencing, immunohistochemistry (ihc) and microscopy of tissue specimens for histopathology. as revealed by pcr, among a total of chlamydia-positive females, were tested positive in one or more segments of one or both oviducts, were found positive in the uterus, and concomitant infections of both organs were observed in of them. sequencing of pcr products revealed the following chlamydial species: chlamydophila (cp.) psittaci (n = 18), cp. abortus (n = 2), chlamydia (c.) suis (n = 10), and c. trachomatis (n = 3). immunopositive staining was observed within the surface epithelium (in a, i, u), stromal tissue (in i, u) and muscular layer (in a, i, u). a total of females had inflamed oviductal segments (in a and/or i) and inflamed uteri. however, there was no relationship between histopathology and results of pcr or ihc. in conclusion, chlamydiae were found to infect oviducts and uteri of pigs. further studies are required to clarify whether chlamydial infection causes specific histopathology and alters tubal function.	biology
in each of two experiments, male broiler chicks (ross 1) were randomised into groups each containing birds. from the age of seven days they were given one of six experimental diets. these were a control diet having ground wheat as the main cereal source and five other diets in which mainly the wheat was replaced by increasing amounts (100, g kg−1 diet) of dried cassava root meal. neither body weight nor food intake were significantly affected in either experiment by the inclusion of dried cassava root meal at levels up to g kg−1. food conversion efficiency was unaffected by dietary treatment except in experiment after weeks, when the diet with g cassava meal kg−1 resulted in a better food conversion efficiency than in the case of the other dietary treatments. the carcass and abdominal fat weights and the chemical composition of the carcasses were unaffected by dietary treatment. in the caecal contents the proportion of acetic acid was increased and that of propionic and valeric acids reduced by the inclusion of dried cassava root meal. the moisture content of the litter was not significantly affected by the presence of cassava root meal although the litter became wet and sticky in the groups given the two highest levels of cassava root meal in experiment 1. for this reason, the maximum recommended level of inclusion of dried cassava root meal in broiler diets is 30%.	biology
abstract rat embryonic mesencephalic cultures were treated with the dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (mpp+), and gm1 ganglioside added after the toxin. twelve days after a 24-h exposure to mpp+, there was a significant decrement in tyrosine hydroxylase (th) and aromatic l -amino acid decarboxylase (aaad) activities. in addition, th mrna was decreased, whereas aaad mrna was no different from control cultures. adding gm1 to control unlesioned cultures had no effect on th activity or mrna. in contrast, gm1 modestly increased both the activity and mrna for aaad. in the mpp+-treated cultures, gm1 induced a partial recovery of th and aaad activity and increased mrna for both above unlesioned control levels. our studies demonstrate that gm1 upregulates the synthetic enzymes for dopamine in mpp+-lesioned embryonic mesencephalic cultures, and suggest that th and aaad respond differentially to the neurotoxin insult.	biology
this study shows the rapid and differential production of the 40–43 kda and the 70–90 kda α1-acid glycoprotein (agp) fucosylated glycoforms after treatment of the dorsal air pouch with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps), hgcl2 or freund's complete adjuvant (fca). the 40–43 kda and the 70–90 kda agp production is peaked 1–3 h post-lps treatment. we observed that the responses to lps and fca are similar in that both agp isoforms are induced whereas they differ in that the fca exhibits a h lag period. the response to hgcl2, however, exhibits the specific biphasic induction only of the 40–43 kda agp. the serum 40–43 kda agp glycoform gradually increases in response to all of the above stimulants and peaks by h post- treatment. the increase of the 70–90 kda agp levels in the air pouch occurs in association with the accumulation of polymorphonuclear (pmn) cells while dexamethasone (dex) increases only the 40–43 kda agp production in the absence of pmn accumulation. macrophage–monocyte lineage cells forming the air pouch lining tissue may potentially be the cells that secrete the 40–43 kda agp while polymorphonuclear cells that infiltrate the air pouch secrete the 70–90 kda agp. the 40–43 kda and 70–90 kda agp production induced by lps in the air pouch precedes that of interleukin-1 (il-1) or interleukin-6 (il-6) while the 40–43 kda agp glycoform potentially increases il-6 production by air pouch pmn exudate cells. these significant differences suggest a local pro-inflammatory role of agp. honeybee venom suppressed arthritis development and exhibited differential local or systemic regulation of agp in serum vs. air pouch exudate or synovial fluid. this study with the air pouch model of facsimile synovium tissue suggests that local α1-acid glycoprotein (agp) production may contribute to pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory activities during the local acute phase response or during chronic inflammatory stress as in arthritis.	biology
department of environmental horticulture, university of seoul, seoul 130-743, korea(received on june 2010; accepted on november 2010)the expression of hr-like lesion inducing gene of oryzasativa (oshrl) was slightly increased by xanthomonasoryzae pv. oryzae (xoo) infection. transgenic rice plantsover-expressing oshrl gene were challenged with xooand the development of disease symptoms were examin-ed to investigate the effect of oshrl gene expression onplant defense responses. the over-expression of oshrlincreased disease resistance against xoo compared withwild type plants. keywords :avrbs2 homologue, oshrl, rice, xanthomonasoryzae pv. oryzaerice is one of the most important crop species, and its yieldis constantly affected by several major diseases such asbacterial blight, blast, sheath blight, and tungro (dai et al.,2007). bacterial blight, caused by xanthomonas oryzae pv.oryzae (xoo), is a serious agronomic problem in many rice-growing regions (mew et al., 1993). therefore, under-standing of molecular mechanisms underlying host resis-tance to pathogens is essential to develop better controllingstrategies against rice diseases. because of availability ofthe genome sequences, rice (sasaki et al., 2005) and xoo(lee et al., 2005) are considered as a model system of plantand bacterial pathogen, respectively (li et al., 2006). it has been previous reported that the avrbs2 gene, whichwas identified in many species of xanthomonas, encodesagrocinopine synthase and glycerol phosphodiesterase(swords et al. 1996). the avrbs2 of xanthomonas cam-pestris pv. vesicatoria (xcv) is specifically recognized bypepper bs2 resulting in localized cell death and plantresistance (mudgett et al., 2000). we thus attempt to iden-tify avrbs2-interacting partner from rice. avrbs2 (kearneyand staskawicz, 1990; swords et al., 1996) homologue wasselected from xoo strain kacc10859 (k1 race), based ongenomic sequences of xoo strain kacc10331 (k1 race,lee et al., 2005). xoo strain kacc10859 harbors singlecopy gene of avrbs2 which is used as bait to isolate inter-acting host components using yeast two-hybrid screening.possible involvement in plant immunity of one selectedgene, oshrl encoding hr-like lesion inducing protein,was evaluated. rice (o. sativa l. cv. dongjin) seedlings were grown for6 weeks in a greenhouse under controlled temperature (20-30°c) and natural light conditions. for bacterial inocula-tions, xoo strain was grown in peptone sucrose medium at28°c (karganilla et al., 1973). the cells were collected bycentrifugation, and diluted to od	biology
the dna microarray is a powerful, high throughput technique for assessing gene expression on a system-wide genomic scale. it has great potential in pain research for determining the network of gene regulation in different pain conditions, and also for producing detailed gene expression maps in anatomical areas that process nociceptive stimuli. however, for the potential of this high throughput technology to be realised in pain research, microarrays need to be combined with other technologies. laser capture microdissection is capable of isolating small populations of homogenous cells, allowing distinct areas involved in nociceptive processing to be examined. in combination with sophisticated pcr-based amplification protocols this technique provides sufficient amounts of messenger rna (mrna) for application to microarrays. aside from the technological issues, a difficult task in any microarray study is the analysis of the resulting enormous data set to reveal the key genes, whose regulation is central to the phenotypic changes observed. for this to be achieved, the methods of data analysis, pattern searching and feature recognition, and bioinformatics have to be properly deployed all within the context of an appropriate statistical design. these issues are especially relevant to pain research where interindividual and interpopulation variation is likely to be high, and where polymorphisms can greatly affect nociceptive sensitivity and susceptibility to pain conditions. methods for assessing the function of new candidate genes identified in microarray screening experiments are also discussed.	biology
abstract background two siblings from consanguineous parents of turkish descent presented with isolated dilated cardiomyopathy, leading to early death in infancy. the diagnosis of mitogenic cardiomyopathy was made histologically. methods and results linkage analysis combined with exome sequencing identified a homozygous deleterious mutation in the alms1 gene as the cause of this phenotype. conclusions alstrom syndrome is characterized by a typically transient dilating cardiomyopathy in infancy, suggesting that mitogenic cardiomyopathy represents the extreme phenotype, resulting in demise before the other clinical symptoms become evident. this observation further illustrates the role of alms1 and cell cycle regulation.	biology
activation of nf-κb transcription factors by receptors of the innate or adaptive immune system is essential for host defense. however, after danger is eliminated, nf-κb signaling needs to be tightly downregulated for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. this review highlights key negative regulatory principles that affect the amount, localization or conformational properties of nf-κb-activating proteins to attenuate the nf-κb response. these mechanisms are needed to prevent inflammation, autoimmune disease and oncogenesis.	biology
summary vacuoles were examined in cells and protoplasts of a fast growing tomato ( lycopersicon esculentum cv. lukullus) cell suspension culture by light and fluorescence microscopy. in protoplasts prepared from cells of the exponential growth phase a great number of small vacuoles occurred. the number of vacuoles decreased during the cell cycle until a single large vacuole was observed. vacuoles were released from protoplasts prepared from cells of the late exponential growth phase (3.5 days) by the action of deae-dextran or by shaking in an alkaline buffer containing edta and purified by centrifugation in discontinuous sorbitol/sucrose/fi-coll-gradients. only slight or no contamination of the vacuolar fraction by cytosol, mitochondria, and microbodies was shown by use of marker enzymes. vacuoles contained approximately 2.5% each of dna and rna. α-mannosidase was located exclusively in the vacuole and served as a convenient marker. acid proteinase and β-n-acetylglucosaminidase were highly enriched in isolated vacuoles whereas acid phosphatase activity was low. during repeated centrifugation of isolated vacuoles about 35% were destroyed at each step. vacuoles could be kept at 4°c for hours and at 30°c for hour without changing their centrifugation properties if the buffers contained mm each of mgcl , cacl , and 0.5% (w/v) human serum albumine.	biology
photosystem i (psi) is a multisubunit enzyme that catalyzes the light-driven oxidation of plastocyanin or cytochrome c6 and the concomitant photoreduction of ferredoxin or flavodoxin. to identify the surface-exposed domains in psi of the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. pcc we mapped the regions in psae, psad, and psaf that are accessible to proteases and n-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (nhs-biotin). upon exposure of psi complexes to a low concentration of endoproteinase glutamic acid (glu)-c, psae was cleaved to 7.1- and 6.6-kd n-terminal fragments without significant cleavage of other subunits. glu63 and glu67, located near the c terminus of psae, were the most likely cleavage sites. at higher protease concentrations, the psae fragments were further cleaved and an n-terminal 9.8-kd psad fragment accumulated, demonstrating the accessibility of glu residue(s) in the c-terminal domain of psad to the protease. besides these major, primary cleavage products, several secondary cleavage sites on psad, psae, and psaf were also identified. psaf resisted proteolysis when psad and psae were intact. glu88 and glu124 of psaf became susceptible to endoproteinase glu-c upon extensive cleavage of psad and psae. modification of psi proteins with nhs-biotin and subsequent cleavage by endoproteinase glu-c or thermolysin showed that the intact psae and psad, but not their major degradation products lacking c-terminal domains, were heavily biotinylated. therefore, lysine-74 at the c terminus of psae was accessible for biotinylation. similarly, lysine-107, or lysine-118, or both in psad could be modified by nhs-biotin.	biology
we present a literature survey and analysis of the profile of mites (acari, exclusive of ixodida) in recent literature and on the world wide web, and compare their prominence to that of spiders (araneae). despite having approximately the same number of described species, spiders outshine mites on the web, although the study of mites (acarology) is better represented than the study of spiders (araneology). broad searches of scientific literature imply that publications on mites exceed those on spiders by 2-3x; however, this dominance was reversed when a smaller number of journals with broad readerships and no taxonomic orientation (e.g., nature, science) were surveyed. this latter analysis revealed that the topical content of mite and spider papers in these general-science journals differs significantly. a troubling leveling-off of taxonomic publications on mites also was discovered. we conclude by suggesting some strategies that acarologists and editorial boards might follow in order to raise mites to their proper status as exemplary models for ecological and evolutionary research.	biology
abstract neanthes virens (sars) were exposed to acute lethal and chronic sublethal concentrations of pentachlorophenol (pcp) in the laboratory. coelomic fluid glucose and osmolality and tissue ascorbic acid and glycogen were monitored in order to assess the time-course response of this polychaete to pollutant stress. glycemic responses and alterations in tissue ascorbic acid and glycogen levels were observed to be dose and time-dependent. during the acute lethal exposure (720 μg/i initially), a hypoglycemic response was evident during the first h of exposure. at a less severe but still lethal exposure concentration (365 μg/i initially), a significant hyperglycemic response was observed after h. the coelomic fluid glucose levels decreased gradually during the 4-day exposure as glycogen reserves were depleted. during the chronic (ca. 2-mth) exposure to μg pcp/1. no unusual glycemic responses were observed. glycogen reserves remained constant during the first month of exposure but were significantly depleted after mth. ascorbic acid levels became elevated in pcp-exposed worms after i wk in both parapodial tissue and posterior segments. this tendency continued throughout the exposure period and the difference between the exposed and control values was statistically significant at the termination of the experiment. an uptake and depuration experiment with14c-pcp was also conducted. polychaetes exposed to μg/l14c-pcp for wk accumulated ca. times the ambient exposure concentration on a wet weight basis. after wk of depuration the mean pcp body burden of depurated animals had decreased by 29%.	biology
we used an immunosuppressed rat model to test the hypothesis that normal mechanisms regulating surfactant phosphatidylcholine synthesis and secretion in alveolar type ii cells are aberrant in pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. animal groups included: group healthy controls; group immunosuppressed, without pneumocystosis; group immunosuppressed with pneumocystosis; group immunosuppressed with well-established pneumocystosis treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (tmp-smx). type ii cells were isolated from rats in each group and compared for [3h]choline incorporation into phospholipid and response of the type ii cells to secretagogues. incorporation of [3h]choline into phospholipid subclasses exhibited significant differences. incorporation into phosphatidylcholine fell from 89.3 +/- 2.2% of total incorporation in group control rats to 79.6 +/- 3.1% in group rats with p. carinii pneumonia, while incorporation into sphingomyelin rose from 5.6 +/- 1.2% in group animals to 15.2 +/- 2.7% in group rats. incorporation of [3h]choline into phospholipid subclasses in cells from group and group animals was not different from incorporation for group animals. type ii cells from group and group (immunosuppressed control) rats responded appropriately to the secretagogues atp, tpa, and terbutaline with a marked increase in surfactant phosphatidylcholine secretion; the effect of atp was also blocked by the lectin, concanavalin a. in contrast, type ii cells from group rats failed to respond to the secretagogues with a significant increase in phospholipid secretion. although treatment of group rats with tmp-smx markedly reduced the p. carinii organism burden, type ii cells from these animals also responded poorly to the secretagogues. the depressed type ii cell function described here provides a mechanism for the observed decrease in surfactant phospholipids from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of experimental animals and patients with p. carinii pneumonia. the data also suggest this defect may become irreversible with advanced disease.	biology
abstract to gain new insight into the biological function of the human augmenter of liver regeneration (halr) in hcc, we studied its involvement in radiation-induced damage and recovery of hcc cells. we found that halr expression was up-regulated in both hcc tissues and multiple hepatoma cell lines and correlated significantly with increased radiation clonogenic survival after radiation treatment. exogenous expression of halr increased radiation resistance in smmc-7721 cells, and the increased survival was accompanied by a decrease in apoptosis and a prolonged g –m arrest after irradiation. overexpression of alr significantly increased the mitochondrial membrane potential, inhibited cytochrome c release, and opposed the loss of intracellular atp levels after radiation. moreover, knockdown of alr by sirna resulted in inhibition of viability in the absence of exogenously added oxidative stress and radiation sensitization in hepg2 cells. importantly, halr expression was very low in normal hepatocyte l02 cells, and halr silencing had a minimal effect on l02 viability and radiation sensitivity. these results suggest that human alr is important for hepatoma cell viability and involved in the protection of hepatoma cells against irradiation-induced damage by its association with mitochondria. targeting halr may be a promising novel approach to enhance the radiosensitivity of hepatoma cancers.	biology
f0f1-atpase within chromatophore was constructed as a molecular motor biosensor through e-subunit antibody-biotin-streptavidin-biotin-ac5-sulfo-osu system. based on probe-dna specific binding, dna of several foodborne pathogens listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, vibrio parahaemolyticus and vibrio cholerae was specifically captured by f0f1-atpase molecular motor biosensors. loads of dna decreased the rotation rate of f0f1-atpase, and led to the decrease of atp synthesis. the detection of pathogens based on proton flux change driven by atp-synthesis of f0f1-atpase, which was indicated by f-dhpe, was monitored by a fluorescence spectrometer. the results demonstrate that the f0f1-atpase molecular motor biosensor can specifically detect bacterial dna at low concentration level, and will be a convenient, quick, and promising tool for detecting pathogens.	biology
abstract ganglioside gq1b was found to induce terminal differentiation in normal epidermal keratinocytes (yada et al. (1991) biochem. j. 665-670). in gq1b-stimulated human keratinocytes, the increase in mrna expression of type i tgase preceded the increases in the tgase activity. the enhancement of its mrna expression was inhibited when protein kinase c (pkc) was suppressed by pretreatment with an inhibitor, h-7, or down-regulation by long-term preincubation with phorbol dibutyrate. these results indicate that pkc is involvedin the activation of tgase probably via gene expression of tgase mrna in gq1b-induced human keratinocyte differentiation. similar results were also obtained in ca2+-induced differentiation.	biology
a cdna encoding a schistosoma japonicum aspartic proteinase was cloned, sequenced, and found to encode a zymogen of amino acid residues, and its gene was shown to be present as a single copy in the s. japonicum genome. identity comparisons showed that the enzyme (sjpasp) was most closely related to the cathepsin ds. the deduced amino acid sequence has four potential glycosylation sites, two of which are in identical positions to the two glycosylation sites of human kidney lysosomal cathepsin d. furthermore, all four disulfide bonds found in mammalian cathepsin d sequences are present in sjpasp, although the β-hairpin (loop 3), which is cleaved during maturation of vertebrate cathepsin ds to yield light and heavy chain subunits, is absent from sjpasp. while most residues involved in substrate specificity and catalysis of aspartic proteinases are preserved in sjpasp, several residues in these regions exhibit changes that may result in a novel substrate specificity. aspartic proteinase activity is present in extracts of adult s. japonicum and schistosoma mansoni and in culture media in which schistosomes were maintained and was capable of digesting hemoglobin. the schistosome aspartic proteinase may play a pivotal role in the catabolism of hemoglobin obtained from host erythrocytes.	biology
following microinjections of a colloidal gold complex into the nucleus paragigantocellularis (pgi) of the ventral medulla, and of latex microspheres into the nucleus abducens (abd) of the same animal, retrogradely labeled neurons were identified in the region of the contralateral supraoculomotor nucleus (som) in the ventromedial periaqueductal gray (pag). neurons labeled from the abd were found in the som in the ventromedial pag throughout the midbrain, as well as scattered ventrally in the oculomotor nucleus. neurons in the som area retrogradely labeled from the pgi were most numerous rostral to the dorsal raphe nucleus and extended throughout the level of the oculomotor nucleus. direct comparison of the two labels revealed that the neurons that project to the abd were located slightly more ventrally than pgi-projecting neurons. almost no doubly labeled neurons were identified, although singly labeled neurons formed adjacent but separate populations. these results indicate that neurons in the som area projecting to the pgi are distinct from those projecting to the abd, and that the pgi-projecting neurons are probably not pre-oculomotor neurons. given their more dorsal location and the nature of their target neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla, pgi-projecting neurons may be related to visceromotor, as opposed to oculomotor functions.	biology
an evaluation of the geographic distribution of °60% of the described nearctic ichneumonidae shows that of the species whose latitudinal ranges contact a given latitudinal band, the number per million square kilometres is greatest between latitude 37.5° and 42.4°n, with °900 species/106 km2. the most severe absolute drop in species richness occurs in moving southward from the 37.5°—39.9° band to the 38.0°—37.4° band, with virtually no change in land mass over the same latitudinal change, and the smallest drop in species richness occurs in moving from the 32.5°—34.9° band to the 30.0°—32.4° band, where the land mass is almost halved. of species whose southern range ends in a particular latitudinal band, the number per million square kilometres is greatest for 32.5°—34.4°n and drops away gradually in both directions. these results are consistent with the hypothesis that parasitic hymenoptera do not increase in species richness with decreasing latitude to the same degree as their hosts. various hypothes...	biology
in animal cells, the primary cilium transduces extracellular signals through signaling receptors localized in the ciliary membrane, but how these ciliary membrane proteins are retained in the cilium is unknown. we found that ciliary membrane proteins were highly mobile, but their diffusion was impeded at the base of the cilium by a diffusion barrier. septin (sept2), a member of the septin family of guanosine triphosphatases that form a diffusion barrier in budding yeast, localized at the base of the ciliary membrane. sept2 depletion resulted in loss of ciliary membrane protein localization and sonic hedgehog signal transduction, and inhibited ciliogenesis. thus, sept2 is part of a diffusion barrier at the base of the ciliary membrane and is essential for retaining receptor-signaling pathways in the primary cilium.	biology
airway inflammation in bacterial infections is characterized by the presence of neutrophils and often epithelial injury and repair. release of endotoxin from bacteria may contribute to these processes. the purpose of this study was to determine the in vivo effects of repeated endotoxin exposure on dna synthesis in rat nasal epithelium in the presence and absence of neutrophilic influx. rats were intranasally instilled, once a day for days, with endotoxin or saline (controls). before the first and third instillations, half of the saline and endotoxin-instilled animals were depleted of circulating blood neutrophils by administering a rabbit anti-rat neutrophil antiserum. rats were sacrificed or h after the last instillation. two hours prior to sacrifice, rats were intraperitoneally injected with bromodeoxyuridine (brdu), an analog of thymidine that is incorporated in the nucleus of cells in the s-phase of the cell cycle. nasal tissues were processed for light microscopy and immunohistochemical detection of brdu in nasal epithelial cells. the numbers of nasal epithelial cells, brdu-labeled epithelial nuclei, and neutrophils per millimeter of basal lamina in the epithelium lining the nasal turbinates in the proximal nasal passages were determined by morphometric analysis. the authors did not observe a neutrophilic influx inmore » the nasal tissues of neutrophil-depleted rats at or h after the last endotoxin instillation; however, the numbers of nasal epithelial cells and the brdu-labeling index were significantly increased compared to saline-instilled controls. in contrast, non-neutrophil-depleted rats instilled with endotoxin had a marked neutrophilic influx, but no significant differences in the number of nasal epithelial cells at or h, compared to controls. in addition, the brdu-labeling index in neutrophil-sufficient rats was increased only h after the last instillation, compared to controls.« less	biology
the latest works on iniopterygians question their monophyly when considering only the neurocranium of the two families (sibyrhynchidae and iniopterygidae), which have different conditions of preservation. some of the synapomorphies of the iniopterygia concern the pectoral girdle and fins. however, the anatomy of these different elements is still poorly known in this taxon. here we describe in details three dimensionally preserved cartilages of the pectoral girdle and fins of the sibyrhynchid iniopera sp. these structures have been extracted virtually from phosphatised nodules thanks to conventional and synchrotron microtomography, using absorption and phase contrast based techniques in the later case. the pectoral girdle of iniopera sp. consists of three elements, which are, from dorsal to ventral, a paired suprascapular cartilage, a pair of robust scapulocoracoids and an unpaired intercoracoid cartilage. the scapular part of the scapulocoracoids is extremely reduced and the suprascapular cartilages link the scapulcoracoids to the rear of the neurocranium. these characters may be iniopterygian synapomorphies. iniopterygians, stem and crown-holocephalans share a basipterygium that articulates with the pectoral girdle and bears an enlarged first pectoral fin radial. posteriorly, the basipterygium articulates with either a well-defined metapterygium (in crown-holocephalans) or a metapterygial axis (in stem-holocephalans).	biology
cytoplasmic and nuclear hypertrophy in neurons from the last pairs of sensory ganglia left in situ cranially to the plane of amputation occurs during lizard tail regeneration. cytophotometry after feulgen staining demonstrated the presence of some neurons, from hypertrophic ganglia, whose quantity of dna exceeded the diploid level (hyperdiploid neurons). in the present work agarose gel electrophoresis of total genomic dna extracted from hypertrophic ganglia showed one or two bands migrating below the high molecular weight dna, pointing to a selective amplification of discrete dna segments.	biology
pubertal development in teleost fish is characterized by gonadal growth that is directly stimulated by the pituitary gonadotropins, fsh and lh. we used a quantitative ribonuclease protection assay to provide, for the first time, the developmental profiles of the alpha-, betafsh-, and betalh-subunit gene expression in a seasonal breeding fish, the female striped bass (3-yr study, n = 207). two-year-old females were sexually immature, although a transient rise in all gonadotropin subunit mrnas was measured in the pituitary. pubertal ovarian development occurred in 65% of 3-yr-old females, characterized by the appearance of lipid droplets within the oocytes. this reproductive phase, termed pubertal development, was associated with a 34-fold increase in the mrna levels of betafsh and a rise in the pituitary concentration of lh. the first sexual maturation took place in 4-yr-old females and coincided with a 218-fold increase in the mrna levels of betafsh. during this time period, the mrna levels of the alpha and betalh subunits increased by 11- and 8-fold, respectively. at the final stages of vitellogenic growth, mrna levels of betafsh declined to basal levels, whereas the mrna levels of the alpha and betalh subunits remained elevated. throughout the study, pituitary lh concentration was positively correlated to the mrna levels of betalh, but plasma levels of lh remained low and unchanged (0.4-0.8 ng/ml) despite increasing levels of pituitary lh concentration, suggesting a regulated secretion pathway. taken together, the data show that the profiles of betafsh and betalh mrnas appear to follow an annual rhythm that is associated with developmental events in the growing oocytes. in particular, increasing levels of betafsh mrna appear to underlie the first sexual maturity in the female striped bass.	biology

abstract the toxicity of several organic insecticides to coho (oncorhynchus kisutch) and chinook salmon (o. tshawytscha), rainbow trout (salmo gairdneri), and the threespine stickleback (gasterosteus aculeatus) was determined. toxaphene, aldrin, dieldrin, ddt, lindane, methoxychlor, heptachlor, chlordane, endrin, guthion, malathion, co-ral, and sevin were tested. toxicity was determined at 20° c. in standing water bioassays which lasted hours. endrin was the most toxic substance tested; the 96-hour median tolerance limit (tlm) for coho salmon was 0.51 parts per billion. with the exception of co-ral and sevin, the 96-hour tlm values of all insecticides tested were near parts per billion (0.1 p.p.m.), or much less. the toxicity of the insecticides to threespine sticklebacks in waters of and parts per thousand salinity was not markedly different at the two salinities.	biology
in photosynthetic eukaryotes, nonphotochemical plastoquinone (pq) reduction is important for the regulation of photosynthetic electron flow. in green microalgae where this process has been demonstrated, the chloroplastic enzyme that catalyses nonphotochemical pq reduction has not been identified yet. here, we show by an rna interference (rnai) approach that the nda2 gene, belonging to a type ii nad(p)h dehydrogenases family in the green microalga chlamydomonas reinhardtii, encodes a chloroplastic dehydrogenase that functions to reduce pq nonphotochemically in this alga. using a specific antibody, we show that the nda2 protein is localized in chloroplasts of wild-type cells and is absent in two nda2-rnai cell lines. in both mutant cell lines, nonphotochemical pq reduction is severely affected, as indicated by altered chlorophyll fluorescence transients after saturating illumination. compared with wild type, change in light excitation distribution between photosystems ('state transition') upon inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport is strongly impaired in transformed cells because of inefficient pq reduction. furthermore, the amount of hydrogen produced by nda2-rnai cells under sulfur deprivation is substantially decreased compared with wild type, which supports previous assumptions that endogenous substrates serve as source of electrons for hydrogen formation. these results demonstrate the importance of nda2 for nonphotochemical pq reduction and associated processes in c. reinhardtii.	biology
the sensory and motor connections of the cervical vagus nerves and of its inferior ganglion (nodose ganglion) have been traced in the medulla and upper cervical spinal cord of male wistar rats by using horseradish peroxidase (hrp) neurohistochemistry. the use of tetramethyl benzidine (tmb) as the substrate for hrp permitted the visualization of transganglionic and retrograde transport in sensory nerve terminals and perikarya, respectively. the vagus nerve in the rat enters the medulla in numerous fascicles with points of entry covering the entire lateral aspect of the medulla extending from level +4 to - mm rostrocaudal to the obex. fascicles of vagal sensory fibers enter the dorsolateral aspect of the medulla and travel to the tractus solitarius (ts) which was labeled for over 8.8 mm in the medulla. the caudal extent of the ts receiving vagal projections was found in lamina v of the cervical spinal cord (c1 to c2). sensory terminal fields could be visualized bilaterally in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (nts), area postrema (ap) and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (dmnx). the ipsilateral projection to the nts and the dmnx was heavier than that found on the contralateral side. the area postrema was intensely labeled on both sides. motor fibers from hrp-labeled perikarya in the dmnx travel ventromedially in a distinct fascicle and subsequently subdivide into a number of small fiber bundles that traverse the medullary reticular formation in the form of a fine network of hrp-labeled fibers. as these fibers from the dmnx approach the ventrolateral aspect of the medulla they are joined by axons from the nucleus ambiguus (na), nucleus retroambigualis (nra) and the retro facial nucleus (nrf). these latter fibers form hairpin loops in the middle of the reticular formation to accompany the axons from the dmnx exiting from the medulla in a ventrolateral location. hrp-labeled perikarya, in contrast to transganglionically transported hrp in sensory terminals in the nts, were visualized on one side only, thus indicating that motor control via the vagus nerve is exerted only by motor neurons located ipsilaterally. sensory information on the other hand, diverges to many nuclear subgroups located on both sides of the medulla.	biology
this study was concerned with the handling of ingested tubercle bacilli by normal human macrophages. intracellular growth was determined after exposure of macrophages to viable bacilli in vitro and the effect of various cytokines, alone or in combination, on bacilli growth/survival was determined. it was found that mycobacterium tuberculosis (m.tb) grew quite readily in untreated cultured human macrophages. treatment with soluble factors showed that a crude lymphokine containing supernatant elicited with concanavalin a (con a) was ineffective at reducing growth of m.tb in vitro; similarly a crude lymphokine preparation from m.tb lysate-stimulated mononuclear cells failed to induce any mycobacteriostatic activity in human monocyte-derived macrophages. recombinant cytokines were then evaluated for their ability to modulate growth of the tubercle bacilli in human macrophages. recombinant interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma), interleukin-2 (il-2) and recombinant interleukin (il-4) were all ineffective at modifying m. tuberculosis growth in human macrophages. recombinant tumour necrosis-alpha (tnf-alpha) curbed the growth of the bacilli in human macrophages in a reproducible fashion. no cytokine combination was more efficient than tnf-alpha alone. these studies thus highlight the resistance of virulent mycobacteria against different mechanisms of cytokine-induced macrophage bactericidal activity.	biology
seabirds show a range of patterns of sexual size dimorphism and sex-specific parental investment, but the underlying causes remain poorly understood. the aim of the present study was to test two longstanding hypotheses of parental investment in a sexually monomorphic species, wilson’s storm petrel oceanites oceanicus, namely that males attend chicks more frequently and females deliver larger meals (beck and brown in br antarct surv sci rep 69:1–54, 1972). we recorded in eight seasons, both during incubation and chick rearing, which adult was caught first in a nest and found no difference in the probability of catching a male or a female first in any year. additionally, in five seasons we employed a miniature video camera to record nest attendance during chick rearing and found no significant difference except for a year with very low krill availability, where females visited the nest less often than males. we then combined video observations with periodic weighing of chicks to estimate mean daily feeding mass (g/day) of males and females and found no difference in the amount of food delivered per day between the sexes. however, in years with low krill availability, males and females tended to use different strategies to achieve the same feeding rates, with females undertaking longer foraging trips and delivering heavier meals. thus, our results do not support the hypothesis of a general sex-specific parental investment in wilson’s storm petrels, but a tendency for a context-dependent sex-specific investment in the years of food shortage.	biology
galectins are a family of carbohydrate binding proteins with a broad range of cytokine and growth factor-like functions in multiple steps of cancer progression. they contribute to tumor cell transformation, promote tumor angiogenesis, hamper the anti-tumor immune response, and facilitate tumor metastasis. consequently, galectins are considered as multifunctional targets for cancer therapy. interestingly, many of the functions related to tumor progression can be linked to galectins expressed by endothelial cells in the tumor vascular bed. since the tumor vasculature is an easily accessible target for cancer therapy, understanding how galectins in the tumor endothelium influence cancer progression is important for the translational development of galectin-targeting therapies.	biology
a new dna reporter construct has been designed for protein quantification by immuno-pcr. it has been shown that the amplification efficiency of a reporter that contains a fragment of human adenovirus flanked by homoprimer sequences is much higher than standard pcr format based on two different primers. the further application of the new construct and its homoprimer-based detection could represent new ways to increase the sensitivity of the immuno-pcr and the efficiency of single-molecule pcr.	biology
background. antrodia cinnamomea is an edible fungus commonly used in asia as a well-known medicinal herb capable of treating drug intoxication and liver cancer. methods. this study evaluated the anticancer activity of its biotechnological product, mycelial fermentation broth (ac-mfb) on hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) by tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay in vitro and syngeneic balb/c 1mea.7r.1 tumor implantation model in vivo. given that cancer stem cell characteristics, such as angiogenesis, invasiveness, and migration, are known to cause recurrence, we further evaluated the effect of ac-mfb on cellular viability inhibition of hcc cells, angiogenic activity and migration of endothelial cells, and the release of proangiogenic factors from hcc cells. results. we found that ac-mfb markedly inhibited the growth of hcc without hepatic enzyme abnormality. this anti-hcc activity was validated by growth-inhibitory effects on both cultured murine 1mea.7r.1 and human ha22t/vgh hcc cells. for cancer stem cell characteristics, ac-mfb inhibited the cellular viability, migration, and tube formation activity of ea. hy926 and svec4-10 endothelial cells. production of extracellular vascular endothelial growth factor and intracellular hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha from hcc cells was suppressed by ac-mfb. conclusion. antrodia cinnamomea could inhibit the growth and cancer stem cell characteristics of hcc cells.	biology

fungal infections and leishmaniasis are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. the macrolide polyene antibiotic amphotericin b (amb) has long been recognized as a powerful fungicidal and leishmanicidal drug. a conventional intravenous dosage form of amb, amb- deoxycholate (fungizone or d-amb), is the most effective clinically available for treating fungal and parasitic (leishmaniasis) infections. however, the clinical efficacy of amb is limited by its adverse effects mainly nephrotoxicity. efforts to lower the toxicity are based on synthesis of amb analogues such as amb esters or preparation of amb-lipid associations in the forms of liposomal amb (l-amb or ambisome), amb lipid complex (abelcet or ablc), amb colloidal dispersion (amphocil or abcd), and intralipid amb. these newer formulations are substantially more expensive, but allow patients to receive higher doses for longer periods of time with decreased renal toxicity than conventional amb. modifications of liposomal surface in order to avoid res uptake, thus increased targetability has been attempted. emulsomes and other nanoparticles are special carrier systems for intracellular localization in macrophage rich organs like liver and spleen. injectable nano-carriers have important potential applications as in site-specific drug delivery.	biology
transduction in the semicircular canal was studied by focusing an infrared beam on either side of exposed ampullae from the posterior canals of rana pipiens . the direction of fluid movement resulting from a stimulus was inferred by observing the polarity of the change in afferent impulse mean rate relative to the spontaneous value. on the basis of the accepted functional polarization of this receptor, the results indicate that fluid moved toward the warmer side of the ampulla. convection and thermal reception were shown to be unlikely explanations for these results. morover, cupular displacements toward the warmer side would not be expected. because thermo-osmosis can cause fluid to move toward the warmer side in a gelatin membrane, the results can be interpreted as evidence that thermo-osmosis occurred in the gelatinous cupula and influenced the transduction mechanism. thermo-osmosis of liquids appears to be due to an electric field that is set up in a charged membrane; hence, the hair cells might have detected an electric field that occurred in the cupula during thermo-osmosis. electroreception might be an important link in the transduction of physiological stimuli also. rotational stimuli could result in weak electric fields in the cupula by the mechanoelectric effect. cupular displacements could be important for large stimuli, but extrapolations to threshold stimuli suggest displacements of angstrom amplitudes. therefore, electroreception by the hair cells could be an explanation of the great sensitivity that has been observed in the semicircular canal and other labyrinthine receptors.	biology

binding of human plasminogen to streptococcus pneumoniae and its subsequent activation promotes penetration of bacteria through reconstituted basement membranes. in this study, we have characterized a novel pneumococcal surface protein with a molecular mass of kda, designated eno, which specifically binds human plasmin(ogen), exhibits alpha-enolase activity and is necessary for viability. using enzyme assays, we have confirmed the alpha-enolase activity of both pneumococcal surface-displayed eno and purified recombinant eno protein. immunoelectron microscopy indicated the presence of eno in the cytoplasm as well as on the surface of encapsulated and unencapsulated pneumococci. plasminogen-binding activity was demonstrated with whole pneumococcal cells and purified eno protein. binding of activated plasminogen was also shown for eno; however, the affinity for plasmin is significantly reduced compared with plasminogen. results from competitive inhibition assays indicate that binding is mediated through the lysine binding sites in plasmin(ogen). carboxypeptidase b treatment and amino acid substitutions of the c-terminal lysyl residues of eno indicated that the c-terminal lysine is pivotal for plasmin(ogen)-binding activity. eno is ubiquitously distributed among pneumococcal serotypes, and binding experiments suggested the reassociation of secreted eno to the bacterial cell surface. the reassociation was also confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy. the results suggest a mechanism of plasminogen activation for human pathogens that might contribute to their virulence potential in invasive infectious processes.	biology
the tumor-inhibitory antibiotic, raromycin is produced by a soil strepmyces which differs from any previously described members of the genus. we therefore regard it as representing a new species for which the name s. albochromogenes is assigned. morphological, physiological and serological characteristics of the cultures of this organism is described in detail. it is closely related to s. griseochromogenes.	biology
one important target of boron (b) deficiency and aluminum (al) toxicity is cell wall. thus we studied the hypothesis that b is capable of alleviating al toxicity in pea (pisum sativum). short-term and prolonged al exposure to pea roots at different b levels was carried out on uniform seedlings pre-cultured at a low b level. when seedlings with a low b level were supplied with or without b for and days before h al exposure, roots were longer while root diameter was thinner after b addition especially for days even with exposure to al; root elongation was inhibited while root diameter was enlarged by al exposure. callose induction by al toxicity was higher with b added, but this was reversed after the removal of the cotyledons. hematoxylin staining was lighter in the root tips given b, and al content in the root tips and cell walls dropped after exposure to b. this indicates that b alleviated al toxicity in the root tips during short-term al exposure by decreasing al binding in root cell walls. an increase in chlorophyll and biomass and reduced chlorosis were found at the higher level of b during prolonged al treatment, which was coincided with the decreased al contents, indicating that b alleviated al toxicity to shoots. b supplementation alleviates some of the consequences of al toxicity by limiting some al binding in cell walls, resulting in less injury to the roots as well as less injury to the shoots.	biology
the effect of egf stimulation and its inhibition with gefitinib ('iressa', zd1839), an epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been investigated in two egfr-positive human bladder tumour cell lines, rt112 and rt4. the growth of rt112 cells in a medium containing 10% foetal bovine serum was inhibited by 50% with microm gefitinib, whereas this dose completely inhibited rt4 cell growth. cells were more sensitive to growth inhibition in the serum-free medium. increased growth of cells in the serum-free medium was observed with or ng x ml(-1) egf and the proliferative effect of egf stimulation in both cell lines was inhibited in the presence of microm, but not 0.1 microm gefitinib. zymography of the conditioned medium from rt112 cells treated with egf and gefitinib showed a decrease in matrix metalloproteinase (mmp2) concentrations. western blot analysis showed that tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1(timp1) increased in the conditioned medium from rt112 cells treated with egf, and this was partially inhibited with both and microm gefitinib. conversely, timp2 decreased with egf stimulation and this was reversed with gefitinib. tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase had no effect on the growth of either cell line. these studies show alterations in the balance of mmps and their inhibitors in egf-stimulated bladder tumour cells, which are reversed by gefitinib, suggesting gefitinib should be investigated for its effect on human bladder tumours.	biology

loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) allows rapid amplification of nucleic acids under isothermal conditions. in this report, a 20-min lamp amplification of the dpol gene of infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (isknv) using a biotin-labeled primer was combined with lateral flow dipstick (lfd) chromatography for rapid and simple visual detection of isknv-specific amplicons. the lfd process involves a 5-min specific hybridization with an fitc-labeled dna probe to confirm the presence of complement isknv amplicons that were biotinated in lamp. the resulting dna duplexes, consisting of labeled probes and amplicons, migrate along the lfd strip by chromatography for min and are trapped at the test line and visualized by biotin labeling. the detection limit of isknv by lamp-lfd was copies. the results show that the lamp-lfd method has the advantages of better sensitivity and speed and less dependence on equipment than the standard pcr for specifically detecting low levels of isknv dna, and this can be useful in the field as a routine diagnostic tool.	biology
disruption of the two thioredoxin genes in yeast dramatically affects cell viability and growth. expression ofarabidopsis thioredoxin attrx3 in thesaccharomyces thioredoxin δ strain emy63 restores a wild-type cell cycle, the ability to grow on methionine sulfoxide, and h2o2 tolerance. in order to isolate thioredoxin targets related to these phenotypes, we prepared a c35s (escherichia coli numbering) thioredoxin mutant to stabilize the intermediate disulfide bridged complex and we added a polyhistidine n-terminal extension in order to purify the complex rapidly. expression of this mutant thioredoxin in the wild-type yeast induces a reduced tolerance to h2o2, but only limited change in the cell cycle and no change in methionine sulfoxide utilization. expression in the δ thioredoxin strain emy63 allowed us to isolate a complex of the thioredoxin with ylr109, an abundant yeast protein related to pmp20, a peroxisomal protein of candida. no function has so far been attributed to this protein or to the other numerous homologues described in plants, animals, fungi, and prokaryotes. on the basis of the complementation and of low similarity with peroxiredoxins, we produced ylr109 and one of itsarabidopsis homologues in e. coli to test their peroxiredoxins activity. we demonstrate that both recombinant proteins present a thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase activityin vitro. the possible functions of this new peroxiredoxin family are discussed.	biology
the x chromosome (chr) genes for phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetases and prps1 and prps2, were mapped on the mouse x chr with interspecific backcrosses between c57bl/6 (b6) and m. spretus (s). southern analysis showed that prps1 mapped between plp and dxwas31, a mouse x chr region that is homologous to xq21-24 on the human x chr while prps2 mapped between dxwas31 and amg, a region that is homologous to the map position of prps2 on xp22 of the human x chr. additionally, other restriction fragments highlighted by prs ii showed autosomal segregation. in situ hybridization and fish analysis of metaphase chromosome spreads prepared from lymphocytes of b6 or s male mice confirmed that there were in fact two different locations on the x chr, x f1-2 and x f2-3 for prps1 and respectively, as well as two autosomal sites for prps-like genes.	biology
abstract the common association of malnutrition and infection has led to many studies that have examined the effects of nutritional status on immunocompetence. children with the syndromes of marasmus and kwaskiorkor show marked impairment of cell-mediated immunity (cmi), complement system, microbicidal function of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn), and secretory iga antibody response. the extensive literature on this burgeoning field has been summarized 1–5,40 clinical malnutrition, however, is a complex combination of the deficiencies of many nutrients, including proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, vitamins, macrominerals and trace elements. thus it is of fundamental importance to examine the influence of individual dietary factors on immune responses and disease (fig. 1). here ranjit chandra discusses the role of trace elements in host resistance to infection and other pathological diseases.	biology
background. the somatostatin analogue octreotide impairs intestinal regeneration and the adaptive response to intestinal resection by inhibition of enterocyte migration and proliferation and increased apoptosis. epidermal growth factor (egf) stimulates regeneration and adaptation by increasing proliferation and reducing apoptosis. the aim of this study was to determine the effect of egf on octreotide-induced enterocyte apoptosis. methods. twenty-four rabbits underwent patch enteroplasty in the distal ileum to stimulate the mucosa. there were four study groups: octreotide μg/kg/ day, egf μg/kg/day, egf plus octreotide, and control. normal ileal mucosa adjacent to the patch was evaluated at days for villus height, crypt depth, crypt cell production rate (ccpr), and in situ end labeling of dna fragmentation. results. octreotide alone increased apoptosis compared with controls at the villus tip (40 ± 7% vs ± 7%, p < 0.05), lateral villus (9 ± 2% vs ± 2%, p < 0.05), and crypt (15 ± 3% vs ± 3%, p < 0.05). egf decreased apoptosis in the crypt (2 ± 1%) and villus (6 ± 1% villus tip and ± 1% lateral villus, p < 0.05) compartments. egf inhibited octreotide-induced apoptosis in the crypt (5 ± 2%) but not the villus (31 ± 5% villus tip and ± 2% lateral villus, p < 0.05). mean dna fragmentation was significantly greater in octreotide-treated animals (p < 0.05). the octreotide-treated animals had reduced crypt depth and villus height but normal ccpr compared with controls. egf increased ccpr and crypt depth compared with controls. combining egf and octreotide resulted in crypt depth and ccpr similar to those of controls but reduced villus height. conclusions. egf inhibits octreotide-induced apoptosis. this effect is greater in crypt than in villus enterocytes. octreotide appears to have both direct and indirect effects on enterocyte apoptosis.	biology

abstract previously reported changes in the deoxyribonucleoprotein (dnp) complex of human leucocytes responding to phytohemagglutinin (pha) were further investigated in the present work by using the alkaline bromphenol blue (bpb) binding reaction for basic proteins. the extraction of dna preceding the bpb-binding was performed both in trichloroacetic acid (tca) and in picric acid (pa). tca liberates both arginine and lysine residues for the subsequent bpb-binding. pa, which was found to bind strongly to the guanidino-groups of arginine, mainly liberates the lysine residues for the following bpb-binding. by measuring the amounts of pa and bpb bound after pa-hydrolysis and bpb staining, information was obtained about the relative amounts of arginine and lysine in histone bound to dna. in pha-treated cells a 25% decrease in bpb-binding was observed after tca-hydrolysis. no such decrease in bpb-binding could be demonstrated after pa-hydrolysis. however, as much as an 80% decrease was found in the pa-binding capacity. these results were interpreted as a reduced number of arginine residues in histone bound to the dna-phosphate groups in cells exposed to pha.	biology
during a 1-year-study in tropical panama, prey of the social theridiid anelosimus eximius was analysed at two locations and compared with the potential prey spectrum according to sweepnet catches, pitfall traps and bowl traps. compared with other web-building spiders, a. eximius catch an unusually high number of large insects: about 90% are flying ants, beetles,lepidopterans hemipterans, cockroaches and grasshoppers. this is the result of a communal strategy to overwhelm prey. webs are maintained commonly, and several spiders attack an entangled insect simultaneously. more spiders participate on insects that are larger and struggle more. the ability to catch large prey insects is discussed as a major driving factor for sociality in spiders.	biology
high nitrate concentration is a problem when lettuce (lactuca sativa l.) is grown under low light intensities. genotypes with low nitrate concentrations have been identified and are being used in breeding programmes. previous results indicated the occurrence of genotype × environment (ge) interactions. because of the important influence of light intensity on nitrate accumulation, two types of interactions may be expected: interactions related to daily variation, and those related to annual variation. in the present investigation both types were investigated using eight butterhead genotypes of lettuce which were repeatedly harvested. no daily variation in nitrate concentration and no corresponding ge-interactions were found, irrespective of the level of global radiation. in contrast, a large annual variation and important corresponding ge-interactions were found. joint regression analysis on environmental means and on physical factors related to light intensity showed a differential response of genotypes to changing environmental conditions. multiple joint regression on daylength and change in daylength accounted for two-thirds of the interaction variance. however, deviations from regression were still significant indicating non-linearity of the relationship, or, the existence of other environmental factors contributing to ge-interaction.	biology
measurements of basal metabolic rate (bmr) and physique were made on gurkha soldiers stationed in britain, and on british controls matched by body weight and occupational background. gurkhas were significantly shorter, with greater body mass index, calf circumference and subscapular skinfold thickness than the european controls, although there was no difference in bmr between the two groups. for the gurkhas, linear regression analysis incorporating factors which may influence bmr showed a positive relationship between the length of time since leaving nepal and bmr, supporting the view that asians living in temperate regions have higher bmr than those living in the tropics.	biology
diverse stressors impede female receptivity and fertility. since epinephrine is released from the adrenal during stress, it might play a role in stress-induced disruptions of female reproductive parameters. experiment examined whether exogenous epinephrine would disrupt lordosis behavior in estrogen- and progesterone-treated ovariectomized female mice. single dosages of and micrograms almost eliminated sexual receptivity. experiments and examined whether chronic dosages of epinephrine shortly after insemination would lead to a failure of implantation of mouse embryos. results indicated that epinephrine had little effect on the number of dams delivering pups, the number of pups born, litter weight, or the number of stillbirths.	biology
the protein pgchp is a new chitosanase produced by penicillium chrysogenum as51d that showed antifungal activity against toxigenic molds. two isoforms were found by sds-page in the purified extract of pgchp. after enzymatic deglycosylation, only the smaller isoform was observed by sds-page. identical amino acid sequences were obtained from the two isoforms. analysis of the molecular mass by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry revealed six major peaks from to kda that are related to different levels of glycosylation. the pgchp gene has 1,146 bp including four introns and an open reading frame encoding a protein of amino acids. the translated open reading frame has a predicted mass of kda, with the first amino acids comprising a signal peptide. two n glycosylation consensus sequences are present in the protein sequence. the deduced sequence showed high identity with fungal chitosanases. a high level of catalytic activity on chitosan was observed. pgchp is the first chitosanase described from p. chrysogenum. given that enzymes produced by this mold species are granted generally recognized as safe status, pgchp could be used as a food preservative against toxigenic molds and to obtain chitosan oligomers for food additives and nutraceuticals.	biology
abstract objective: to analyse in situ the placental expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (tnf-α), its receptors tnfrp55 and tnfrp75, and apoptosis in normotensive and preeclamptic pregnancies. design and methods: we simultaneously analyzed the immunostaining of tnf-α, its receptors and apoptosis in term placentas of patients with preeclampsia and normotensive pregnant women as controls. results: in normotensive villi tnf-α and tnfrp75 were expressed more in syncytiotrophoblasts than cytotrophoblasts or stromal cells, and were almost absent in endothelial cells. tnfrp55 was expressed uniformly in all types of placental cells. apoptosis was more marked in syncytiotrophoblasts than cytotrophoblasts. in preeclamptic trophoblasts apoptosis was exaggerated whereas expression of tnf-α and its receptors remained unchanged. conclusions: placental expression of tnf-α and tnfrp75 appear inter-adaptative and follow the same pattern, whereas tnfrp55 and tnf-α appear independent. in addition, the exaggerated apoptosis of preeclamptic trophoblasts may be dependent on factors other than the tnf-α system alone.	biology
n23 and n24, selected from hundreds of ad-3 mutants, have been used as testers for the spot, plate and suspension tests in neurospora crassa. these two testers are highly sensitive to mutagens and are revertible by a specific group of chemicals. n23 can be reverted from an adenine-dependence to adenine-independence by agents which cause base-pair substitutions whereas n24 can be reverted by frameshift mutagens. studies described here show that spot, plate and suspension tests using testers n23 and n24 are satisfactory substitutes for the ad-3 forward-mutation system for screening the mutagenic activity of environmental agents and chemical carcinogens in n. crassa.	biology
the brain-specific compound naa (n-acetylaspartate) occurs almost exclusively in neurons, where its concentration reaches approx. mm. its abundance is determined in patients by mrs (magnetic resonance spectroscopy) to assess neuronal density and health. the molecular identity of the nat (n-acetyltransferase) that catalyses naa synthesis has remained unknown, because the enzyme is membrane-bound and difficult to purify. database searches indicated that among putative nats (i.e. proteins homologous with known nats, but with uncharacterized catalytic activity) encoded by the human and mouse genomes two were almost exclusively expressed in brain, nat8l and nat14. transfection studies in hek-293t [human embryonic kidney-293 cells expressing the large t-antigen of sv40 (simian virus 40)] indicated that nat8l, but not nat14, catalysed the synthesis of naa from l-aspartate and acetyl-coa. the specificity of nat8l, its km for aspartate and its sensitivity to detergents are similar to those described for brain asp-nat. confocal microscopy analysis of cho (chinese-hamster ovary) cells and neurons expressing recombinant nat8l indicates that it is associated with the er (endoplasmic reticulum), but not with mitochondria. a mutation search in the nat8l gene of the only patient known to be deficient in naa disclosed the presence of a homozygous bp deletion, resulting in a change in reading frame and the absence of production of a functional protein. we conclude that nat8l, a neuron-specific protein, is responsible for naa synthesis and is mutated in primary naa deficiency (hypoacetylaspartia). the molecular identification of this enzyme will lead to new perspectives in the clarification of the function of this most abundant amino acid derivative in neurons and for the diagnosis of hypoacetylaspartia in other patients.	biology
abstract the ingestion of bacillus thuringiensis crystal endotoxin by manduca sexta causes the destruction of both goblet and columnar cells of the midgut. one hour after ingestion, the microvilli show pathological effects. nearly complete destruction of the goblet and columnar cells has taken place after hr exposure to the toxin.	biology
treatment of stem sections of peach (prunus persica (l.) batsch) and flowering dogwood (cornus florida l.) with macerase, an enzyme mixture rich in pectinase, for 24–48 h resulted in a complete flattening of the low-temperature exotherm (lte) as determined by differential thermal analysis (dta). ultrastructural analysis of macerase-treated tissue demonstrated a nearly complete digestion of the pit membrane (black cap and primary cell-wall) of nearly 100% of the xylem-parenchyma cells examined after h of exposure to the enzyme. additionally, the underlying amorphous layer was partially degraded in up to 57% of the cells examined. the macerase treatment had no visible effect on secondary cell-walls of xylem tissue. in contrast, treatment of stem tissue with cellulysin (mostly cellulase) resulted in a shift of the lte to warmer temperatures as determined by dta, and a digestion of only the outermost layer of the pit membrane in nearly 100% of the cells examined, with little or no effect on the underlying layers. treatment of tissue with mm sodiumphosphate buffer also resulted in a shift of the lte to warmer temperatures but the shift was not as great as in cellulysin-treated tissue. the shift was associated with a partial degradation of the outermost layer of the pit membrane in dogwood (33–45% of the cells examined) but not in peach (3–7% of the cells). collectively, the data indicate that pectins may be an integral structural element of the pit membrane and that this portion of the cell-wall, along with the underlying amorphous layer, play a major role in forming a barrier to water movement and growth of ice crystals. this barrier allows xylem parenchyma of some species of woody plants to undergo deep supercooling.	biology
abstract: a controlled balance among cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis is required for the maintenance of gastrointestinal mucosa; these processes are influenced by luminal components, such as butyrate and bile acids. using butyrate-sensitive (bcs-tc2) and butyrate-resistant (bcs-tc2.br2) human colon carcinoma cells, we wanted to establish whether colon carcinoma cells that acquire resistance to butyrate-induced apoptosis are also resistant to the cytotoxic effect of certain bile acids, contributing, in this way, to the progression of colon carcinogenesis. the effect of bile acids on bcs-tc2 cell viability is dose and time dependent and highly stereospecific. quantification of the relative percentage of apoptotic cells and caspase-3 activity reveals that deoxycholic acid (dca) and chenodeoxycholic acid (cdca) induce apoptosis in bcs-tc2 cells. bcs-tc2.br2 cells are consistently less sensitive to their cytotoxic effects, requiring concentrations to induce 50% inhibition (ic50) in cell viab...	biology
herbivorous primary consumers are a key intermediate trophic linkage between primary production from microalgae, macrophytes, and vascular plants and higher-level consumers. fatty acid (fa) biomarkers are useful for evaluating trophic interactions in aquatic ecosystems because of clear phylogenetic separation of algal group fa signatures. we used a fa-based bayesian mixing model (fastar) to generate quantitative diet estimates of algal phyla for an intertidal herbivorous isopod, idotea wosnesenskii, at sites in puget sound, washington, usa. we generated a 'resource library' of fa signatures of isopods fed diverse algal diets in 10-wk feeding trials and used these empirical data to parameterize fastar, thus accounting for isopod modification of dietary fa. the fa profiles of fast-growing juvenile idotea were closely related to the signatures of their diets, and several polyunsaturated fa (pufa) were highly correlated between diet and consumer (e.g. sigma c-18 omega + c-18 omega 20:4 omega and 20:5 omega 3). we used the model to characterize individual isopod diet variability within sites and to test whether isopods utilize specific algal phyla preferentially or in similar proportions to algae available in the field. the results identified both variation in resource utilization among individual isopods within certain sites, and site level similarities with total available algal cover. body mass index of wild isopods was highest at sites where the model indicated high utilization (e.g. >30%) of both green and brown algae and low support from red algae. this novel fa-based mixing model approach demonstrated the potential for quantitative diet estimations of fast-growing aquatic herbivorous consumers.	biology
the kinetics of association between the quinoxaline antitumor antibiotic echinomycin and dna have been studied by stopped-flow methods. with natural dnas, the reaction profile is completely described by a single exponential, the time constant for which varies linearly with the dna concentration. this bimolecular rate constant is similar for both calf thymus and micrococcus lysodeikticus dna (k = x 10(4) m-1 s-1 at degrees c, i = 0.01) and is probably dominated by interaction with relatively weak but abundant binding sites from which the antibiotic dissociates fairly quickly. the observed single exponential suggests a molecular mechanism of binding in which both chromophores of the antibiotic become intercalated simultaneously rather than sequentially; no transition from a mono-intercalated state to a bis-intercalated state could be detected. the reaction is slowed by a factor of about on raising the salt concentration from i = 0.01 to i = 0.5. binding to poly(da-dt) is also described by a single exponential, the time constant for which is about times faster than that seen with natural dnas. by contrast, the interaction with poly-(dg-dc) requires two exponentials for a proper description, the faster of which is similar to that seen with natural dnas. this may reflect the initial interaction of the antibiotic with two types of sequences, tentatively identified as gpc and cpg, from which it dissociates at very different rates. the differences in kinetic behavior may be explicable on the basis of an alternating b structure for poly(da-dt) and a more classical b form for poly(dg-dc).	biology
we investigated the genetic control of immunoglobulin production and the delayed-type hypersensitivity (dth) response produced by an hiv-specific dna vaccine using several strains of mice. murine antigen-specific immunoglobulin production was determined by elisa. the dth response was assessed in terms of the footpad swelling reaction. all strains of mice, except for b10.riii and b10.t(6r), exhibited strong immunoglobulin production and footpad swelling in response to the dna vaccine. in vitro treatment of lymphoid cells with monoclonal antibodies showed that the footpad swelling response was mediated by cd4+8− and ia— t cells. however, cd8+ t cells did not suppress footpad swelling. there was no difference in the induction of hiv-specific immunoglobulin production or dth response induced by the dna vaccine among the strains, suggesting that hiv-specific dna vaccine is useful for immunizing various populations against hiv-1.	biology
"heterozygosity in diploid eukaryotes often makes genetic studies cumbersome. methods that produce viable homozygous diploid offspring directly from heterozygous females allow f1 mutagenized females to be screened directly for deleterious mutations in an accelerated forward genetic screen. streisinger et al.1,2 described methods for making gynogenetic (homozygous) diploid zebrafish by activating zebrafish eggs with ultraviolet light-inactivated sperm and preventing either the second meiotic or the first zygotic cell division using physical treatments (heat or pressure) that deploymerize microtubules. the ""early pressure"" (ep) method blocks the meiosis ii, which occurs shortly after fertilization. the ep method produces a high percentage of viable embryos that can develop to fertile adults of either sex. the method generates embryos that are homozygous at all loci except those that were separated from their centromere by recombination during meiosis i. homozygous mutations are detected in ep clutches at between 50% for centromeric loci and less than 1% for telomeric loci. this method is reproduced verbatim from the zebrafish book3."	biology

echinomycin, daunomycin, ethidium bromide, nogalamycin, chromomycin, mithramycin, and olivomycin inhibit rna synthesis by rna polymerase by interacting with the dna template. chromomycin and olivomycin form complexes with dna, preferably in the helical form, but not with rna. these complexes require guanine in dna and the addition of a stoichiometric amount of bivalent cation. none of the other antibiotics requires the presence of any single base in the template for its action.	biology
in addition to expressing clonally distributed antigen-specific and major histocompatibility complex (mhc)-restricted receptors, t cells also express non-clonally distributed surface molecules that are involved in t-cell function. among the most intriguing of the latter are l3t4 and lyt which are expressed on individual t lymphocytes in striking, though not absolute, concordance with their restriction by either class ii or class i mhc determinants, and which are thought to contribute to the overall avidity of t-cell interactions by binding to monomorphic determinants on class ii and class i mhc molecules, respectively. to examine the ability of t cells to recognize a single class ii domain in the absence of the remainder of the ia molecule, as well as to evaluate the structural basis for the putative interaction of l3t4 with ia, a recombinant class ii/class i murine mhc gene was constructed and introduced into mouse l cells. here we demonstrate that a subset of class ii allospecific cytotoxic t lymphocytes (ctl) can specifically recognize and lyse l-cell transfectants expressing an isolated polymorphic a beta domain, and that anti-l3t4 antibody can block such killing, a result inconsistent with the highly conserved membrane-proximal domains of ia acting as unique target sites for l3t4 binding.	biology
partial cdnas encoding a pokeweed antiviral protein were obtained by polymerase chain reaction from the poly(a)+ rna of seeds, leaves, and roots using two specific primers based on the amino acid sequence of a pokeweed antiviral protein from the seeds (pap-s). using the cdnas as a radioactive probe, and positive plaques were isolated from libraries containing the genomic dna of phytolacca americana digested with bam hi partially and completely, respectively. the plaques were grouped into nine types by southern hybridization. the type α genomic clone encodes a protein of amino acids. its amino acid sequence is similar but not identical to that of pap-s. a comparison of the two amino acid sequences suggested that the deduced protein contains extrapeptides of and amino acids at the nh2 and the cooh terminals, respectively. the putative protein was expressed in escherichia coli and shown to depurinate the specific adenine of wheat 25s rrna, indicating that the protein encoded by a type α genomic clone is a functional protein exhibiting rna n-glycosidase activity.	biology
the spo11/topvia family includes proteins from archaebacteria and eukaryotes. the protein member from the archaebacterium sulfulobus shibatae is the catalytic subunit of topovi dna topoisomerase. in saccharomyces cerevisiae, schizosaccharomyces pombe, caenorhabditis elegans and drosophila melanogaster, spo11 is required for meiotic recombination, suggesting a conserved mechanism for the initiation step of this process. indeed, s. cerevisiae spo11 has been shown to be directly involved in the formation of meiotic dna double-strand breaks that initiate meiotic recombination. here, we report the identification of a mus musculus spo11 cdna, which encodes a protein closely related to all members of the spo11/topvia family. cdnas resulting from alternative splicing were detected, suggesting that there are potential variants of the mouse spo11 protein. by rna-blotting analysis, expression of the mouse spo11 gene was detected only in the testis, in agreement with its predicted function in the initiation of meiotic recombination. we mapped the mouse spo11 gene to chromosome band h2–h4.	biology
magnesium (mg) deficiency reduces yield and quality of crops as mg is involved in carbohydrate and protein anabolism. foliar application of mgso4 represents a means of ameliorating the nutritional status of crops growing under conditions of deficiency. foliar mg application has been demonstrated to increase the chlorophyll concentration and vegetative yield of plants. however, in crop plants used for seed production, the limited number of available studies provides only conflicting results in terms of the efficiency of mg leaf application on yield and quality. we have examined the effect of increasing mg foliar application rates on differentially developed leaves and leaf stages with regards to mg concentration, chlorophyll concentration and biomass formation. our data reveal that in order to obtain significant effects mgso4 concentrations in the spraying solution should be higher than mm, as lower concentrations did not lead to significant changes in the vegetative or generative material. positive effects of the foliar application on chlorophyll concentration and leaf area were only measured in leaves treated with mm foliar mgso4. the application of mg did not affect the parameters chlorophyll, ion concentration and leaf area in the newly developing leaves, but it had an important influence with regard to yield traits, especially on the formation of pods. the quality of the seeds with regard to the protein concentration was reduced in response to the magnesium deficiency treatment, but the application of foliar magnesium prevented a significant loss of protein.	biology
toxicity effects and field persistence of the insect growth regulators lufenuron, flufenoxuron and triflumuron were assessed in the laboratory using second and fourth larval instars of spodoptera littoralis. laboratory bioassays indicated that lufenuron was more effective on both 2nd and 4th larval instars, as well as killing both larval instars faster than flufenoxuron or triflumuron. field-laboratory experiments were conducted to show direct and residual effects of the tested igrs in terms of toxicity and stability. they indicated that all the tested insecticides were stable under field conditions and give high percentages of mortality. overall, lufenuron was more efficient than the other tested insecticides. in addition, it gave a faster kill in some testing periods. data presented in this work show greater efficiency of lufenuron in controlling s. littoralis than flufenoxuron or triflumuron. using this insecticide for cotton leafworm control in cotton fields may give better results under field condition.	biology
for some genes, notably essential genes, expression when expression is needed is vital hence low noise in expression is favourable. for others noise is necessary for coping with stochasticity or for providing dice-like mechanisms to control cell fate. but how is noise in gene expression modulated? we hypothesise that gene orientation may be crucial, as for divergently organized gene pairs expression of one gene could affect chromatin of a neighbour thereby reducing noise. transcription of antisense non-coding rna from a shared promoter is similarly argued to be a noise-reduction mechanism. stochastic simulation models confirm the expectation. the model correctly predicts: that protein coding genes with bi-promoter architecture, including those with a ncrna partner, have lower noise than other genes; divergent gene pairs uniquely have correlated expression noise; distance between promoters predicts noise; ncrna divergent transcripts are associated with genes that a priori would be under selection for low noise; essential genes reside in divergent orientation more than expected; bi-promoter pairs are rare subtelomerically, cluster together and are enriched in essential gene clusters. we conclude that gene orientation and transcription of ncrnas, even if unstable, are candidate modulators of noise levels.	biology
summary objective: the aim of this study was to compare tooth size measurements between patients with supernumerary teeth and a control group. method: the supernumerary group consisted of subjects (21 females and males) and the control group of subjects (20 females and males). all available permanent teeth on the dental casts were imaged and measured from both buccal and occlusal views using an image analysis system. mesio-distal, bucco-lingual or occluso-gingival dimensions, area and perimeter were measured from each view. results: supernumerary tooth patients tended to have larger tooth size measurements for almost all variables than controls. significant differences (p conclusions: the results are compatible with supernumerary teeth being a complex dental anomaly with a multifactorial aetiology in which both genetic and environmental factors are important. there is some evidence of a local effect with greater differences in tooth dimension adjacent to the site of the supernumeraries.	biology
atopy as defined in terms of ige responsiveness was reported to be controlled by a single gene in british families, and this concept was further supported by a significant linkage between atopy and restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) detected by a dna probe specific to chromosome 11q13. to confirm this observation in a japanese population, segregation and linkage analyses were done in four large families. although segregation patterns of atopy were in agreement with the pattern of autosomal dominant inheritance, there was no significant linkage between atopy and locus 11q13. alterations in the definitions of atopy did not affect the results. these findings suggested the presence of heterogeneity in genetic elements of atopy, even though atopy may be determined mainly by a single dominant gene.	biology
alkyltransferase-like proteins (atls) play a role in the protection of cells from the biological effects of dna alkylation damage. although atls share functional motifs with the dna repair protein and cancer chemotherapy target o 6-alkylguanine-dna alkyltransferase, they lack the reactive cysteine residue required for alkyltransferase activity, so its mechanism for cell protection was previously unknown. here we review recent advances in unraveling the enigmatic cellular protection provided by atls against the deleterious effects of dna alkylation damage. we discuss exciting new evidence that atls aid in the repair of dna o 6-alkylguanine lesions through a novel repair cross-talk between dna-alkylation base damage responses and the dna nucleotide excision repair pathway.	biology
a missense mutation has been identified in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene of a danish patient with hyperphenylalaninaemia (hpa). an a-to-g transition at the second base of codon results in the substitution of cys for tyr in the mutant pah protein. in in vitro expression studies, the tyr414-to-cys414 mutant construct produced a protein which exhibited a significant amount of normal pah enzyme activity, which is consistent with both in vitro and in vivo measurements of pah activity in hpa patients. population genetic studies reveal that this mutation is present on 50% of mutant haplotype chromosomes in the danish population. together with the previously reported codon mutation, these two mutant alleles comprise over 90% of all mutant haplotype chromosomes in the northern europcan population. thus, two allele-specific oligonucleotide probes can detect most mutant haplotype chromosomes in northern europe.	biology
the inhibition of cytokine and monoclonal antibody binding cell surfaces caused by an extract of psychotria acuminata, a medicinal plant used in the traditional medicine of the people of belize (central africa), was attributed to the presence of pheophorbide a and pyropheophorbide a. since the binding of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-8, complement factor 5a as well as epidermal growth factor to target cells was dramatically reduced, the inhibition was not receptor or cytokine specific. in addition, the respective binding of radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies cl203 and r15.7 to the cell surface antigens intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1 and lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 beta-chain was decreased by pretreatment of cells with pheophorbide a as well. in all cases, the inhibition by pheophorbides was dependent on the simultaneous presence of light, indicating causative involvement of a photodynamic process. these observations are not unique to pheophorbides and can be extended to porphyrins as well as to other photodynamic agents. cytotoxicity resulting from photodynamic therapy (pdt) has been documented by many studies. our investigations suggest that the inactivation of cell surface receptors contributes not only to an antitumor effect of pdt but also to the systemic immunosuppression, a serious side effect of pdt.	biology
the diet composition and its use by oreochromis niloticus in lake tana, ethiopia, were studied from monthly samples taken over months. the composition of the diet varied seasonally, with dramatic increases in quality following seasonal climatic events (rainfall, vertical mixing) that bring plant nutrients to the photic zone. thus, organic matter in the diet increased four-fold, from to mg g-1 of diet. protein content increased from to mg g-1 ash free dry weight (afdw). assimilation efficiency increased from 8.3% to 43.2% for afdw, and from near to 45.8% for protein. the fraction of organic matter that is refractory declined from to mg g-1 afdw. condition factor followed the same pattern, but lagged to months behind changes in diet quality. it was concluded that seasonal pattern of rainfall and temperature affect pelagic food resources, hence heterogeneity in diet quality is temporal to a great extent for o. niloticus in lake tana. sinet: ethiopian journal of science vol. no.

bryostatin is a novel macrocyclic lactone activator of protein kinase c (pkc) which has clinical potential as an anti-cancer agent. the mechanism of action of this agent is unknown, but protein kinase c has been implicated. in order to investigate this possibility, we have developed p388 sublines resistant to bryostatin by continuous challenge of the parent cell line with increasing incremental concentrations of the drug over months. cell lines were established at monthly intervals yielding four sublines: p388/br/a, which were removed at month; p388/br/b, obtained after months; p388/br/c, obtained after months; and p388/br/d, which were established after months. all four p388/br sublines show an equal degree of resistance to the growth inhibitory effects of bryostatin with a relative resistance ratio (rr) ic50 of approximately 4,000. the ability of the cytosol of cells to phosphorylate pkc-specific substrate is decreased by 41% for br/a, 57% for br/b 80% for br/c and 94% for br/d compared with the parental cell line, even when grown in the absence of bryostatin for up to weeks. similar decreases are seen for cytosolic phorbol ester binding and whole-cell pkc isoenzyme expression. all four p388/br sublines show high and equal levels of cross-resistance to the pkc activatory phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (pma). there is no loss of resistance to either bryostatin or pma up to months after termination of exposure of the sublines to bryostatin 1. there was no significant degree of cross-resistance to daunorubicin in the bryosatin 1-resistant cell lines, p388/br/a, b, c or d, when compared with the parent cell line, p388.	biology
a new sulfate-reducing bacterium was isolated from marine sediment with hydroxyhydroquinone (1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene) as the sole electron and carbon source. strain hhq grew slowly with doubling times of > h and oxidized hydroxyhydroquinone, lactate, pyruvate, ethanol, fructose, and ribose incompletely to acetate and carbon dioxide, with concomitant reduction of sulfate to sulfide. cells were large, vibrio-shaped, and gram-negative with a g+c content of 49.7 mol%, and contained desulfoviridin. based on analysis of the 16s rrna sequence, strain hhq was found to be related to the genus desulfovibrio but formed a separate line, thus justifying the establishment of a new species within this genus. hydroxyhydroquinone was the only aromatic compound utilized among numerous hydroxybenzoates, hydroxybenzenes, methoxybenzoates, and methoxybenzenes tested, suggesting that phloroglucinol and resorcinol are not degradation intermediates. cell-free extracts of strain hhq did not contain pyrogallol-phloroglucinol transhydroxylase activity. first experiments indicated that this strain uses a new reductive pathway for anaerobic hydroxyhydroquinone degradation.	biology
"in many altricial birds, fledglings disperse when they are no longer fed, and this dispersal marks the end of parental care. in some species, however, young remain in close association with their parents after nutritional independence. because juveniles are still inferior foragers at this stage, they might benefit from parental assistance in locating good feeding sites, but this possibility remains largely unexplored. here, we show that parents and helpers in pied babbler (turdoides bicolor) societies use a recruitment call to direct nutritionally independent, but inexperienced, foragers to particular food patches. observations and a playback experiment indicated that adult babblers use a ""purr"" call to recruit group members to a foraging patch. creation of experimental foraging patches supported observations that individuals tend to give the call when they are foraging on abundant, divisible food sources and when their group contains independent fledglings (youngsters who are no longer fed directly). fledglings responded to calls more often than adults, who frequently encountered aggression from the caller if they did, and the fledglings gained significant foraging benefits. this is the first study to demonstrate that altricial birds may use recruitment calls to extend parental care past the period of direct provisioning."	biology
the surface coat (sc) of plant nematodes is thought to originate either from the living hypodermis or from secretory glands associated with the excretory system or nervous system. in this study, we investigated the origin of the sc of meloidogyne incognita by immunolocalization with a monoclonal antibody raised against the surface coat of the preparasitic juveniles (j2). under the electron microscope, strong labeling was found on the cuticular surface and in the rectal dilation of the j2, while labeling was absent in other parts of the nematode, including the hypodermis, excretory system, nervous system, and digestive system. because the rectal glands are known to be the origin of the gelatinous egg matrix produced by adult females of meloidogyne, we also examined sections of mature females from monoxenic cultures of arabidopsis thaliana. labeling of the female occurred in the rectal glands and in the gelatinous matrix exuded from the anus. at the ultrastructural level, gold particles were mainly deposited in multivesicular bodies that appeared to be associated with the golgi bodies of the rectal glands. our results suggest that at least one component of the j2 sc originates from the rectal gland cells and that the sc of the j2 shares common epitopes with the gelatinous egg matrix of mature females.	biology
abstract this paper discusses the following topics related to polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon pollution in estuaries: (1) the use of oysters (crassostrea virginica), hard clams (mercenaria mercenaria) and brackish water clams (rangia cuneata) in residue monitoring; (2) the effects of elevated pah residues on oyster condition; (3) three years of field studies relating pah sediment contamination to abnormalities in fishes; and (4) laboratory bioassays for effects and bioconcentration modeling. oysters, hard clams and rangia have been shown, from years of field studies, to be good monitors of pollution inputs as one proceeds along salinity gradients from 25‰ to 0·5‰. effects of increased body burdens of pahs are shown by a lowering of the oysters' condition index, as measured by lipid levels. fishes inhabiting the elizabeth river, va, which is highly contaminated with pahs, have abnormalities (cataracts, skin lesions, abnormal fins, etc.). these abnormalities have higher incidence in regions of the river where the sediments are more heavily contaminated. laboratory studies utilizing contaminated sediments have reproduced some of the abnormalities observed in the field. bioconcentration of pahs from sediments has been studied with oysters and hard clams. oysters generally accumulate three times the body burdens of clams exposed to the same suspensions. a faster depuration rate (k2) for clams appears to be responsible for the higher equilibrium body burden of oysters.	biology
we present a review of the normal histology of the thymus, with special emphasis on the developmental, morphologic, and immunohistochemical aspects pertinent to the interpretation of thymic lesions in surgical pathology. attention is drawn to normal variations in histology, embryonal vestiges and developmental defects, involutional and hyperplastic changes, tissue reactions to injury, and biopsy artifacts that may constitute a source of diagnostic problems.	biology
the surface saccharide composition of collagenase-dispersed pancreatic cells from adult guinea pig and rat glands was examined by using eight lectins and their ferritin conjugates: concanavalin a (cona); lens culinaris (lcl); lotus tetragonolobus (ltl); ricinus communis agglutinins i and ii (rca i, rca ii); soybean agglutinin (sba); ulex europeus lectin (uel); and wheat germ agglutinin (wga). binding studies of iodinated lectins and lectin-ferritin conjugates both revealed one population of saturable, high-affinity receptor sites on the total cell population (approximately 95% acinar cells). electron microscopy, however, revealed differences in lectin-ferritin binding to the plasmalemma of acinar, centroacinar, and endocrine cells. whereas acinar cells bound heavily all lectin conjugates, endocrine and centroacinar cells were densely labeled only by cona, lcl, wga, and rca i, and possessed few receptors for ltl, uel, and sba. endocrine and centroacinar cells could be differentiated from each other by using rca ii, which binds to centroacinar cells but not to endocrine cells. some rca ii receptors appeared to be glycolipids because they were extracted by ethanol and chloroform-methanol in contrast to wga receptors which resisted solvent treatment but were partly removed by papain digestion. rca i receptors were affected by neither treatment. the apparent absence of receptors for sba on endocrine and centroacinar cells, and for rca ii on endocrine cells, was reversed by neuraminidase digestion, which suggested masking of lectin receptors by sialic acid. the absence of ltl and uel receptors on endocrine and centroacinar cells was not reversed by neuraminidase. we suggest that the differential lectin-binding patterns observed on acinar, centroacinar, and endocrine cells from the adult pancreas surface-carbohydrate-developmental programs expressed during morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation of the gland.	biology
abstract the complete nucleotide sequence of 5-kb dna fragment immediately 5′ to the rpsu-dnag-rpod macro-molecular-synthesis operon in escherichia coli has been determined. it encodes for six open reading frames. transcriptional and translational analysis have shown that three of them ( orf x , orf z1 and orf z2 ) are expressed in exponentially growing e. coli cells. the orf x , directly 5′ to the rpsu gene but transcribed in the opposite direction, may be part of the rpsu-dnag-rpod macromolecular-synthesis operon.	biology
four nr− lines were selected by their resistance to mm chlorate from x-ray irradiated protoplasts of haploid petunia hybrida var. mitchell. the four cell lines were characterized by the presence of xanthine dehydrogenase activity and by complementation tests via protoplast fusion. one mutant (line 1) was classified as defective in the nr apoprotein (tentatively, nia-type) and the other three (lines 4) in the molybdenum cofactor (tentatively, cnx-type). some nr activity (15 %) could be restored by adding unphysiologically high concentrations of molybdate to the culture medium in two of the cnx-lines (lines and 4). the third cnx-line (line 2) had no nr activity. a complementation analysis via protoplast fusion confirmed that the mutants comprised non-allelic groups. from these results it can be concluded that these nr− mutants are recessive and that two of the cnx-mutants (lines 4) are allelic.	biology
abstract the microplasmodia of the slime mold, physarum polycephalum , coalesce readily upon contact. the nuclei of the resulting macroplasmodia divide in synchrony approx. 6–8 h after coalescence. if prior to coalescence the microplasmodia are maintained on non-nutrient salts solution, followed by continued starvation of the resulting macroplasmodia, the nuclei also will eventually divide, although at a much later time. this mitosis occurs earlier if the starved microplasmodia are irradiated with uv light prior to coalescence. the most pronounced advancement of mitosis was found in plasmodia which were obtained by coalescence of irradiated, starved microplasmodia with non-irradiated ones.	biology
by using a set of recombinant inbred lines (rils) from the cross lemont (japonica) × teqing (indica) and a complete linkage map with well distributed rflp markers and morphological markers, a major gene (xa4) and qtls and pairs of epistkis loci conferring horizontal resistance to three strains of xanthomonas orym pv oryza (xoo) were mapped. the teqing allele at xa4 on chromosome acts as a dominant resistant gene against pathogen race cr4 and cx08, but as an additive qtl with a significantly (47%) reduced effect against the virulent strain, cr6. the major gene xa4 exhibited stronger degree of race specificity. most qtls showed consistent levels of resistance against all three xoo strains. the results suggest that a high level durable resistance to xoo may be achieved by cumulative effects of multiple qtl.	biology
supernumerary ring and large marker chromosomes are a characteristic of atypical lipomas and well-differentiated liposarcomas (alp-wdlps) and are composed of amplified 12q14-15 sequences in association with variable segments from other chromosomes. although stably transmitted, these chromosomes contain centromeric alterations, showing no detectable alpha-satellite sequences. we performed c-banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and immunostaining with anti-centromere antibodies in cases of liposarcomas with supernumerary rings and large markers, including alp-wdlps and dedifferentiated-lps and high-grade lps. our results with alpha-satellite probes and anti-cenpb antibodies confirm the lack of detectable alpha-satellite sequences in the five alp-wdlps supernumerary chromosomes, whereas centromeric activity was proved by the detection of kinetochores by using anti-cenpc antibodies. in contrast, the high grade and dedifferentiated liposarcomas showed a different pattern. in cases, amplified chromosome sequences, including amplification of alpha-satellite sequences in case, were present on chromosomes with typical centromeres. in another case, the rings were similar to wdlps-alp rings, but a large marker contained a chromosome centromere and amplified alpha-satellite sequences from chromosome 8. alp-wdlps is the first example of a tumor class for which the presence of stable analphoid chromosomes is a constant and specific abnormality. formation of newly derived centromeres, so-called neocentromeres, could be an original and effective way to maintain a selective advantage in neoplastic cells by conferring stability to the supernumerary chromosomes of alp-wdlps. the activation of normally non-centromeric sequences might be obtained by an epigenetic mechanism due to the peculiar chromatin conformation of these highly complex chromosomes.	biology
rituximab is a monoclonal antibody drug approved for the treatment of patients with lymphomas. rituximab’s main killing mechanism is antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (adcc). during adcc, rituximab’s fragment antigen binding (fab) region binds to the cd20 antigen on the tumor cell and its fragment crystallizable (fc) region binds to the fc receptor (fcr) on the natural killer (nk) cells. in this study, two types of molecular interactions (cd20–rituximab, fcr–rituximab) involved in adcc were measured simultaneously on cells prepared from biopsy specimens of lymphoma patients by utilizing atomic force microscopy (afm) with functionalized tips carrying rituximab. nk cells were detected by specific nkp46 fluorescent labeling and tumor cells were detected by specific ror1 fluorescent labeling. based on the fluorescence recognition, the binding affinity and distribution of fcrs on nk cells, and cd20 on tumor cells, were quantitatively measured and mapped. the binding affinity and distribution of fcrs (on nk cells) and cd20 (on tumor cells) were associated with rituximab clinical efficacy. the experimental results provide a new approach to simultaneously quantify the multiple types of molecular interactions involved in rituximab adcc mechanism on patient biopsy cells, which is of potential clinical significance to predict rituximab efficacy for personalized medicine.	biology
the interaction between a transcription factor and dna motif (cis-acting element) is an important regulatory step in gene regulation. comprehensive genome-wide methods have been developed to characterize protein-dna interactions. recently, the universal protein binding microarray (pbm) was introduced to determine if a dna motif interacts with proteins in a genome-wide manner. we facilitated the pbm technology using a dsred fluorescent protein and a concatenated sequence of oligonucleotides. the pbm was designed in such a way that target probes were synthesized as quadruples of all possible 9-mer combinations, permitting unequivocal interpretation of the cis-acting elements. the complimentary dna strands of the features were synthesized with a primer and dna polymerase on microarray slides. proteins were labeled via n-terminal fusion with dsred fluorescent protein, which circumvents the need for a multi-step incubation. the pbm presented herein confirmed the well-known dna binding sequences of cbf1 and cbf1/dreb1b, and it was also applied to elucidate the unidentified cis-acting element of the osnac6 rice transcription factor. our method demonstrated pbm can be conveniently performed by adopting: (1) quadruple 9-mers may increase protein-dna binding interactions in the microarray, and (2) a one-step incubation shortens the wash and hybridization steps. this technology will facilitate greater understanding of genome-wide interactions between proteins and dna.	biology
cystic fibrosis (cf) is considered to be a single gene disorder, most commonly the result of a f508del mutation in the cftr gene. however, patients homozygous for f508del mutation show a considerable variation in disease severity. consistent with this observation, recent genome wide association studies identified secondary genes that modify disease. a snp in the putative promoter region of slc6a14 gene showed the highest significance (p=1.28x10−12). slc6a14 is a cationic/neutral amino acid transporter, which transports 2na+, cl− and a basic/neutral amino-acid into the cell from the apical surface of intestinal/bronchial epithelium. we hypothesize that expression of slc6a14 is protective against meconium ileus, a cf phenotype detected at birth. to test this hypothesis we over-expressed slc6a14 in bhk cells stably expressing either wt or f508del-cftr. we measured cftr channel activity using the halide sensitive fluorophore, spq. we found that cftr function is enhanced with over-expression of slc6a14 in cells expressing wt cftr or f508del cftr (after rescue of its trafficking defect), (p<0.05). this suggests a possible functional interaction between slc6a14 and cftr. we also monitored the functional interaction of slc6a14 and cftr in caco-2 cells, an intestinal cell line that endogenously expresses both cftr and slc6a14. caco-2 cells form three-dimensional, cyst-like cultures wherein cftr mediated secretion determines the volume of its internal cavity. we found that the area of the cyst cavity increases upon camp stimulation of cftr stimulation by 5.5 fold and that this expansion was decreased by 44% in the presence of the slc6a14 inhibitor (α-methyltryptophan). these results suggest that slc6a14 exerts a positive effect on regulated cftr function and future studies will explore the possibility that agonists of slc6a14 could constitute a means for therapeutic intervention.(studies supported by grants to c.e.b and j.m.r. from cfc, cihr)	biology
lipid transfer proteins (ltps) are widely distributed in the plant kingdom, but their functions remain elusive. the proteins alltp2-4 were isolated from three related allium plants: garlic (a. sativum l.), welsh onion (a. fistulosum l.), and nanking shallot (a. ascalonicum l.). these novel proteins comprise a new class of ltps associated with the ace-amp1 from onion (a. cepa l.). the alltp genes encode proteins harboring common amino acids and also share a high level of sequence identity. protein characteristics and phylogenetic analysis suggest that ltps could be classified into five distinct groups. the alltps were clustered into the most distantly related plant ltp subfamily and appeared to be restricted to the allium species. in particular, the number of amino acids existing between the fourth and fifth cys residue was suggested as a conserved motif facilitating the categorization of all the ltp-related proteins in the family. unlike other ltps, alltps harboring both the putative c-terminal propeptide and n-terminal signal peptide were predicted to be localized to cytoplasmic vacuoles. when a chimeric gfp protein fused with both n-terminal and c-terminal alltp2 signal peptides was expressed in rice cells, the fluorescence signal was detected in the endomembrane compartments, thereby confirming that alltps are an unprecedented intracellular type of ltp. collectively, our present data demonstrate that alltps are a novel type of ltp associated with the allium species.	biology

objective little is known of the hormone environment of the developing early human embryo. we have therefore measured selected steroids in the intrauterine fluids of early pregnancy. design measurement of progesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, oestradiol-17β, testoste rone, androstenedione, cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate in matched samples of coelomic fluid, amniotic fluid and maternal serum collected before pregnancy termination from women between and weeks gestation. results mean concentrations of progesterone, oestradiol-17β and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone in coelomic fluid were respectively and times greater than in maternal serum and and 2.6 times those in amniotic fluid. concentrations of testosterone and androstenedione were highest in maternal serum and lowest in amniotic fluid. cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate were found in intrauterine fluids only at the limit of detection but in normal concentrations in maternal serum. conclusions coelomic fluid contains relatively high concentrations of progesterone, oestradiol-17β and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone which may be synthesized locally. amniotic fluid contains lower concentrations of steroids (other than progesterone) than are found in coelomic fluid or maternal serum. free diffusion of steroids across the amnion appears limited. this may constitute a mechanism to protect the embryo from unwanted exposure to biologically active steroids.	biology
hydatidosis is a widely endemic helminthic disease vectored in human by the larval stage of the metacestode echinococcus granulosus. it is characterized by the long-term coexistence of chronic infection with detectable humoral and cellular responses against the macroparasite. previous studies demonstrated interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) and nitric oxide (no) production (in vivo and in vitro) during hydatidosis. in this study, we tested the hypothesis that no production after ifn-gamma induction may constitute a host defense against e. granulosus. we also investigated the ifn-gamma effect on protoscolices (larval form of the parasite) viability in coculture with hydatid patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc). pbmcs from hydatic patients incubated with ifn-gamma (100 u/ml) alone are effective in the killing of protoscolices. this scolicidal activity is concomitant with elevation of nitrite levels. no release and cytotoxic activity are inhibited by n-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-nmma), a specific inhibitor of the no pathway and increased by l-arginine, an no precursor, and tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4), a nitric oxide synthase (nos) cofactor. our results indicate that ifn-gamma mediated inos induction as one of host defense mechanism against human e. granulosus infection.	biology
neurotransmitters can have diverse effects that occur over multiple time scales often making the consequences of neurotransmission difficult to predict. to explore the consequences of this diversity, we used the buccal ganglion of aplysia to examine the effects of gaba release by a single interneuron, b40, on the intrinsic properties and motor output of the radula closure neuron b8. b40 induces a picrotoxin-sensitive fast ipsp lasting milliseconds in b8 and a slow epsp lasting seconds. we found that the excitatory effects of this slow epsp are also mediated by gaba. together, these two gabaergic actions structure b8 firing in a pattern characteristic of ingestive programs. furthermore, we found that repeated b40 stimulation induces a persistent increase in b8 excitability that was occluded in the presence of the gaba b receptor agonist baclofen, suggesting that gaba affects b8 excitability over multiple time scales. the phasing of b8 activity during the feeding motor programs determines the nature of the behavior elicited during that motor program. the persistent increase in b8 excitability induced by b40 biased the activity of b8 during feeding motor programs causing the motor programs to become more ingestive in nature. thus, a single transmitter released from a single interneuron can have consequences for motor output that are expressed over multiple time scales. importantly, despite the differences in their signs and temporal characteristics, the three actions of b40 are coherent in that they promote b8 firing patterns that are characteristic of ingestive motor outputs.	biology
lactobacillus plantarum pa18, a strain originally isolated from the leaves of pandanus amaryllifolius, contains a pr18 plasmid. the pr18 plasmid is a 3211bp circular molecule with a g+c content of 35.8%. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed two putative open reading frames, orf1 and orf2, in which orf2 was predicted (317 amino acids) to be a replication protein and shared 99% similarity with the rep proteins of plr1, pld1, pc30il, and plp2000, which belong to the rcr pc194/pub110 family. sequence analysis also indicated that orf1 was predicted to encode lina, an enzyme that enzymatically inactivates lincomycin. the result of southern hybridization and mung bean nuclease treatment confirmed that pr18 replicated via the rcr mechanism. phylogenetic tree analysis of pr18 plasmid proteins suggested that horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants without genes encoding mobilization has not only occurred between bacillus and lactobacillus but also between unrelated bacteria. understanding this type of transfer could possibly play a key role in facilitating the study of the origin and evolution of lactobacillus plasmids. quantitative pcr showed that the relative copy number of pr18 was approximately copies per chromosome equivalent.	biology
es-1 cells, which showed a higher sensitivity to the cytocidal action of estradiol were isolated from a human breast cancer mcf-7 cell line. growth of es-1 cells was inhibited by a dose of 17-beta estradiol that stimulated the growth of the parental mcf-7 cells. proteins secreted from mcf-7 and es-1 cells when cultured with 17-beta estradiol were compared by sodium dodecyl sulfate-containing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). addition of estradiol to culture medium enhanced secretion of a protein of molecular mass of kda in media for both mcf-7 and es-1 cell lines, but the secretion of a second kda protein was enhanced about 10-fold only in es-1 cells. the analysis by sds-page of culture medium immunoprecipitated with anti-tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-pa) antibody demonstrated that the band of kda protein specifically secreted from estradiol-treated es-1 cells contained t-pa. zymography assays, quantitative immunoreactive assays, and northern analysis showed about 5-fold specific increase by estradiol of t-pa with molecular mass of 65-70 kda in es-1 but not in its parental mcf-7 cells. cellular level of the plasminogen activity was also specifically enhanced in es-1 cells by estradiol, but only a slightly in mcf-7 cells. by contrast, another urokinase-type pa (u-pa) with molecular weight of kda showed very low level activity in both mcf-7 and es-1 cell lines in the presence of estradiol. formation of t-pa mrna was specifically enhanced in es-1 cells when es-1 cells were treated for more than h with 10(-8) m 17-beta estradiol. estradiol did not elongate the lifetime of t-pa mrna in es-1 cells. a unique phenotype of es-1 cells in response to estradiol is discussed in relation to activating expression of the t-pa gene.	biology

one hundred and fifty years ago, the english naturalist henry walter bates first developed the theory of mimicry ( ). based on his field observations in the amazon, he argued that the uncanny likeness of unrelated butterflies is an evolutionary adaptation whereby edible butterflies avoid predation by imitating the coloration of venomous butterfly species without paying the cost of arming themselves. such “batesian mimicry” is a dynamic parasitic game between three players, in which a harmless species (the mimic) escapes predation by imitating the warning signals of harmful species (the model) that a shared predator (the dupe) has learned to avoid. on page of this issue, thorogood and davies show that batesian mimicry dynamics also apply to the evolutionary game between cuckoos and their hosts ( ).	biology
understanding of intestinal lipid metabolism, driven at least in part through attempts to mitigate the ongoing epi-demic of obesity and metabolic disease ( ). for example, weight loss strategies including gastric bypass surgery have brought to light unanticipated adaptations in metabolic homeostasis, including altered bile acid signaling and shifts in host-microbial ecology ( ). as a result, our under-standing of the role of the intestine in lipid metabolism now includes an expanded role in a range of homeostatic processes, including glucose metabolism, energy utiliza-tion, and growth and inﬂ ammation to name but a few. our thematic review series will selectively cover several of these areas. in particular, we have solicited reviews that summarize a detailed elucidation of the pathways regulat-ing the ﬂ ux of complex lipids across the small intestinal enterocyte, including an emerging role in energy utiliza-tion and the role of circadian cues. we have also solic-ited reviews to provide a thorough understanding of the molecular, genetic, and regulatory pathways involved in modulating intestinal bile acid transport and signaling and new insights into the role of nuclear hormone receptors in the intestine in maintenance of systemic lipid metabolism. in the ﬁ rst article in our series, eric yen and his colleagues will review the role and regulation of enterocyte triglyceride synthesis, including the abundantly expressed genes acyl coa:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (mgat2) and acyl coa:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (acat1), whose functions have been examined in numerous model sys-tems and have been shown to play crucial roles in the regu-lation of fat metabolism and energy utilization. there is heightened interest also in the possibility that these pathways represent druggable targets for obesity and met-abolic disorders ( ). in the second article, mahmood hussain and xiaoyue pan have summarized some of the recent developments in our understanding of the relevance of circadian rhythm to intestinal lipid metabolism. they summarize the role of innate intestinal clock genes and outline the integration of central signals (via the suprachiasmatic nucleus) with	biology
rna interference (rnai) is an efficient post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism that is induced by double-stranded rna. applications of rnai have gained increasing attention since the groundbreaking discovery that small interfering rna (sirna) molecules can be used to inhibit gene expression in mammalian cells in a sequence-specific manner. numerous meetings have recently been held in this field, but the organiser from ef international succeeded in bringing some of the leading academic scientists and company researchers together in london to present and discuss exciting new results. major topics covered in the meeting included the recent progress in understanding the basic mechanism of rnai, genome-wide rnai-based screens for target discovery, and approaches to use rnai for target validation in cell culture and in animal models. in addition, borders and caveats of the technology, such as off-target effects and a possible induction of the interferon response by sirna, have been discussed intensively....	biology

the morphogenesis of blood cell lineages in channel catfish ictalurus punctatus, from head and trunk kidney and spleen imprints as well as from blood smears of bled and control fish, showed that early maturation stages resembled those in higher vertebrates. the erythroid lineage consisted of the proerythroblast, erythroblasts (basophilic, polychromatic, orthochromic), young erythrocyte and erythrocyte. the rare bilobed erythrocyte seemed to be a cell in apoptosis while old erythrocytes and erythroplastids represented remnants of this process. maturation stages of neutrophils and basophils encompassed the granuloblast, young progranulocyte, progranulocyte and metagranulocyte. the basophilic lineage was regularly present in kidneys, rare in spleen and absent from blood. it contained large sudan black and pas-negative, water soluble granules and small pas-positive ones. lymphocytes with azurophilic granulation occured regularly in kidneys and spleen. monoblasts and promonocytes in kidneys preceded monocytes. a phagocytic lineage devouring apoptotic blood cell remnants was present in kidneys and spleen. its youngest identified stage (promacrophage) resembled more a granuloid cell without granules than a monocytoid one. the larger, young macrophages contained a few to several ingestions and the very large mature macrophages were loaded with them. the latter two stages corresponded to cells in melano-macrophage centres (macrophage aggregates). precursor stages of the thrombocyte were not identified.	biology
ovulation is believed to contribute to the development of ovarian cancers that derive from the ovarian surface epithelium (ose). the process of ovulation is synonymous with inflammation and inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1α (il-1α) have recently been shown to induce both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses in human ose (hose) cells. in this study we directly compared levels of il-1α-induced gene expression by analysing the levels of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11βhsd) types (11βhsd-1) and (11βhsd-2), cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2), il-1 receptor (il-1r) and glucocorticoid receptor α (grα) mrna between normal hose cells and cell lines derived from poorly differentiated (skov-3, bg-1, peo-4) and well-differentiated (peo-14) ovarian adenocarcinoma. in hose cell cultures, and to a lesser extent peo-14 cells, the basal mrna levels of cox-2 and 11βhsd-1 were relatively high and further shown to be induced in response to il-1α (for hose cells; >20-fold, p 3fold, p<0.05). however, whereas hose cells expressed a low level of 11βhsd-2 mrna that was only mildly responsive to il-1α (1.3-fold, p<0.001), all cell lines exhibited a higher basal level of 11βhsd-2 mrna that was in some cases further stimulated in peo-4 cells (five-fold; p<0.05) or suppressed in skov-3 cells (two-fold; p<0.01) in response to il-1α. all cells tested expressed il-1r and, with the exception of bg-1, grα. these results indicate that cell lines derived from ovarian cancers have lost the ability to respond normally to inflammatory cytokines such as il-1α. the finding that normal ose cells, in contrast to cell lines derived from patients with ovarian adenocarcinoma, abundantly express 11βhsd-1 mrna but are essentially devoid of 11βhsd-2 mrna supports the concept that the pattern of 11βhsd isoform gene expression is a defining feature of neoplastic cellular transformation, which might have particular relevance to the ovary.	biology
a total of samples from blood donors screened as anti-hcv negative by two third-generation screening assays (ortho diagnostics v3.0 and murex diagnostics vk48) were tested by two supplementary anti-hcv assays, riba iii (ortho diagnostics) and western blot (murex diagnostics vk68). six (0.65%) of the samples gave scorable bands by riba iii and (0.54%) by western blot. only single-band reactivity was seen and there was no consensus reactivity between the two assays. single-band reactivity in supplementary assays, especially in samples from low-risk populations, needs to be interpreted with care before being taken as indication of genuine previous or current hcv infection.	biology
danell k. 1985: population fluctuations of the muskrat in coastal northern sweden. acta theriol., 12: 219—227 [with table & figs.] the fluctuations of five muskrat populations in coastal northern sweden are described over periods of 7—14 years. the population in sladan was studied more intensively since it colonized this area around 1963. during the last years it fluctuated with a periodicity of years. this time length is identical to the vole cycle length in the area. however, the muskrat population reached their peaks one year after the vole peaks. in the above population the predation pressure by foxes upon muskrats was recorded yearly for years. the predation pressure was negatively correlated with vole density. two other muskrat populations which settled in and respectively, displayed fluctuations similar to those of the voles, and the muskrat peaked with a one year dephasing. two muskrat populations which had colonized their localities more recently (in and 1975) remained for some years at low levels and then steadily increased. the population fluctuations were not directly related to the changes in the vole populations.	biology
as reported previously, the peculiar intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies (ieibs) extensively appeared in the autopsied brain tissue from a 49-year-old man having familial ataxia with cerebrospinal fluid abnormality, and histochemically showed abundant proteins, but few lipids and carbohydrates. ultrastructurally, many membrane-bound vacuoles derived from the distended cisterns of rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum (rer) appeared in the neurons. they were filled with fine granular, less dense materials. the ieibs, shown as a homogeneous dense core, were found in some of the vacuoles. similar vacuoles also appeared in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, vascular pericytes, ependymal and choroidal epithelial cells. it is suggested that the vacuoles result from the accumulation of metabolic products in the distended rer cisterns of the cells in the central nervous system, presumably representing a genetically determined functional abnormality of the rer in protein synthesis and/or transport.	biology
purposedna repair enzymes have a critical role in cellular maintenance and survival. the enzyme apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease/redox factor (ape/ref1), a key protein in the base excision repair pathway, displays both repair and redox control. we examined the role of ape/ref1 in pediatric embry	biology
alfalfa of different maturities was produced simultaneously by varying the timing of the first cut. groups of fistulated steers were confined and simultaneously fed alfalfa herbage at three stages of growth once a day. more bloat occurred during the vegetative stage of growth, it declined during bud development, and it was absent during bloom. this pattern occurred with both the number of cases of bloat and with the severity of bloat, which was much greater during the vegetative stage. feed quality components also varied significantly between stages as did the leaf:stem ratio. key words: cattle, bloat, legumes, medicago sativa l	biology
oncolytic viruses capable of tumor-selective replication and cytolysis have shown early promise as cancer therapeutics. we have developed replication-competent attenuated herpes simplex virus type (hsv-1) mutants, named hf10 and hh101, which have been evaluated for their oncolytic activities. however, the host immune system remains a significant obstacle to effective intraperitoneal administration of these viruses in the clinical setting. in this study, we investigated the use of these hsv-1 mutants as oncolytic agents against ovarian cancer and the use of human peritoneal mesothelial cells (mcs) as carrier cells for intraperitoneal therapy. mcs were efficiently infected with hsv-1 mutants, and mcs loaded with hsv-1 mutants caused cell killing adequately when cocultured with cancer cells in the presence or absence of hsv antibodies. in a mouse xenograft model of ovarian cancer, the injection of infected carrier cells led to a significant reduction of tumor volume and prolonged survival in comparison with the injection of virus alone. our results indicate that replication-competent attenuated hsv-1 exerts a potent oncolytic effect on ovarian cancer, which may be further enhanced by the utilization of a carrier cell delivery system, based on amplification of viral load and possibly on avoidance of neutralizing antibodies.	biology
seventeen mangrove species of eight families at seven riverine and fringe habitats in goa west india were surveyed for arbuscular mycorrhizal (am) fungal diversity. sixteen species were found to be mycorrhizal and one species showed no am fungal colonization. am root colonization was recorded at all seven sites and ranged from 6%–77%. maximum root colonization was recorded in excoecaria agallocha (77%) and minimum colonization in avicennia marina (6%). paris-type colonization was predominant at all sites. auxiliary cells were recorded in roots of acanthus ilicifolius, ceriops tagal and sonneretia alba. am fungal root colonization and spore density varied by plant species and site. site average spore density ranged from 1.84 spores·g−1 to 0.54 spores·g−1 of soil. in total, am fungal species of five genera, viz. glomus, acaulospora, scutellospora, gigaspora and entrophospora, were recovered. glomus was the dominant genus, three species of which were sporocarpic forms. maximum site species richness (sr) ranged from to 5. species richness was maximum in a. ilicifolius where seven species of three genera were recovered. based on relative abundance (ra) and isolation frequency (if), two common species, viz. g. intraradices and a. laevis, were recovered from all seven sites.	biology
a fed-batch culture of methanol-utilizing microorganism (corynebacterium sp. xg), a vitamin b producer, was carried out with constant feed of substrate. experimental results agreed with the theorical model proposed in the literature. using this feeding system, the final biomass and vitamin b concentration reached 16.3 g/l and μg/l respectively after a h incubation period at °c.	biology
abstractearly-life experiences can dramatically affect adult traits. however, the evolutionary origins of such early-life effects are debated. the predictive adaptive response hypothesis argues that adverse early environments prompt adaptive phenotypic adjustments that prepare animals for similar challenges in adulthood. in contrast, the developmental constraints hypothesis argues that early adversity is generally costly. to differentiate between these hypotheses, we studied two sets of wild female baboons: those born during low-rainfall, low-quality years and those born during normal-rainfall, high-quality years. for each female, we measured fertility-related fitness components during years in adulthood that matched and mismatched her early conditions. we found support for the developmental constraints hypothesis: females born in low-quality environments showed greater decreases in fertility during drought years than females born in high-quality environments, even though drought years matched the early c...	biology
phenoloxidase (po) plays an important role in arthropod melanization. previously, a prophenoloxidase (pmpropo1) gene was cloned and characterized from the hemocytes of the black tiger shrimp, penaeus monodon. in the present study, we report a novel propo gene (pmpropo2) belonging to the propo family identified from the p. monodon est database (http://pmonodon.biotec.or.th). the full-length sequence of pmpropo2 consists of bp encoding a predicted amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass and pi of 79.21 kda and 6.69, respectively. it is predicted to possess all the expected features of propo members, including two putative tyrosinase copper-binding motifs with six histidine residues and a thiol ester-like motif, sharing 67% amino acid sequence identity with pmpropo1. tissue distribution analyses revealed that the two propo genes are primarily expressed in the hemocyte. gene silencing of either pmpropo1 or pmpropo2 or both by rna interference (rnai) resulted in a significant decrease in the respective endogenous propo mrna level in hemocytes and a reduction of total po enzyme activity by and 88%, respectively. experimental infection of p. monodon with the pathogenic bacterium, vibrio harveyi, revealed that pmpropo silenced shrimps were more susceptible to bacterial infection than the control gfp injected shrimps, and suggesting that the two propos are important components in the shrimp immune defense.	biology
bet proteins are a group of epigenetic regulators controlling transcription through reading acetylated histone tails and recruiting transcription complexes. they are considered as potential therapeutic targets in many distinct diseases. a novel synthetic bromodomain and extraterminal domain (bet) inhibitor, jq1, was proved to suppress oncogene transcription and inflammatory responses. the present study was aimed to investigate the effects of jq1 on inflammatory response and bone destruction in experimental periodontitis. we found that jq1 significantly suppressed lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated inflammatory cytokine transcription, including interleukin (il)-1β, il-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-α), as well as receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-b ligand (rankl)-induced osteoclast markers, such as c-fos, nuclear factor of activated t-cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent (nfatc1), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (trap) and cathepsin k in vitro. jq1 also inhibited toll-like receptors 2/4 (tlr2/4) expression and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cells (nf-κb) phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (chip-qpcr) revealed that jq1 neutralized brd4 enrichment at several gene promoter regions, including nf-κb, tnf-α, c-fos, and nfatc1. in a murine periodontitis model, systemic administration of jq1 significantly inhibited inflammatory cytokine expression in diseased gingival tissues. alveolar bone loss was alleviated in jq1-treated mice because of reduced osteoclasts in periodontal tissues. these unprecedented results suggest the bet inhibitor jq1 as a prospective new approach for treating periodontitis.	biology
the diploid male has already been recorded for melipona illger, and herein, in melipona seminigra merrillae cockerell and melipona interrupta manaosensis schwarz. this paper was carried out at the instituto nacional de pesquisas da amazonia (inpa), manaus, am, brazil. we produced and monitored new colonies of m. s. merrillae and new colonies of m. i. manaosensis. we sampled 2,995 pupae of m. s. merrillae and 2,020 of m. i. manaosensis. in colonies with a : sex ratio, male diploidy was confirmed by cytogenetic analysis and workers’ behavior. we estimated sex-determining alleles in m. s. merrillae and in m. i. manaosensis. in colonies of m. i. manaosensis in a : sex ratio, workers killed the males and the queen that produced them soon after they emerged, as predicted. this behavior was not registered for m. s. merrillae, and sex ratios did not stay : indicating polyandry for this species.	biology
the present study compared the effect of a single or a repeat challenge with the gram-negative pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis on the local inflammatory response within subcutaneous chamber model in mice. subcutaneous chambers were implanted weeks prior to the final challenge. the repeat-challenge (rep) group received two intrachamber bacterial injections days apart, while the single-injection group (sin) received only a single bacterial challenge. injection of saline was used as the control. the cellular contents of the chamber exudates were used for differential cell counts, and the supernatants were analysed for tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma), and interleukin (il)-10 levels. immunoglobulin g1 (igg1) and igg2a levels to p. gingivalis in the exudates were also determined. the results showed that the leucocyte counts increased significantly post-challenge, and the rep group showed the highest number of lymphocytes and neutrophils. both p. gingivalis-challenged groups exhibited significant increase in tnf-alpha and il-10 levels at day post-challenge. tnf-alpha levels in the chamber exudate were threefold higher in the rep group compared with the sin group on day post-challenge (p < 0.05). in contrast, il-10 levels were significantly lower in the rep group day post-challenge compared with the sin group. the rep group had significantly higher levels of ifn-gamma at baseline, and this difference remained significant day post-challenge. analysis of antibody levels to p. gingivalis showed that while the control and the sin groups had no anti-p. gingivalis igg in the chamber exudate during the 7-day study period, the rep group showed high anti-p. gingivalis igg levels. in addition, the titres of igg2a were fivefold higher than the igg1 titres. the results showed that a repeat local challenge with p. gingivalis augmented the proinflammatory cytokines tnf-alpha and ifn-gamma, while inhibiting the accumulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10. this shift towards a t helper (th1)-dominant response was reflected in the relatively high anti-p. gingivalis igg2a titres in the local inflammatory environment days post-challenge.	biology
the movements of a commercially important species, diplodus vulgaris, were assessed in a marine-protected area to test whether their spatial and temporal activity patterns differ during and outside of their spawning season. twelve adults were caught along the north-eastern coast of a small mediterranean island, tagged with acoustic transmitters and released within or just outside the integral reserve. fish detected, during both the seasons showed strong fidelity for the study area before and during the spawning season and their home range did not differ between seasons. home ranges reached an asymptote between and days after release. home range estimated by kernel utilization distributions ranged from 9,876 to 89,914 m2, with core areas of to 7,274 m2. temporal patterns frequently showed a dominant diel rhythm with most of detections occurring at daytime, independently of season. the variability in the movement patterns of d. vulgaris was lower between seasons (i.e., during and outside the spawning season) than at smaller temporal scale (i.e., between day and night) and was largely affected by inter-individual differences. some conclusions arising from this and previous findings are useful to orient future studies on coastal fish movement and have direct implications for mpas design.	biology
the anthrax toxin lethal factor (lf) and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (mmp-3, stromelysin-1) are popular zinc metalloenzyme drug targets, with lf primarily responsible for anthrax-related toxicity and host death, while mmp-3 is involved in cancer- and rheumatic disease-related tissue remodeling. a number of in silico screening techniques, most notably docking and scoring, have proven useful for identifying new potential drug scaffolds targeting lf and mmp-3, as well as for optimizing lead compounds and investigating mechanisms of action. however, virtual screening outcomes can vary significantly depending on the specific docking parameters chosen, and systematic statistical significance analyses are needed to prioritize key parameters for screening small molecules against these zinc systems. in the current work, we present a series of chi-square statistical analyses of virtual screening outcomes for cocrystallized lf and mmp-3 inhibitors docked into their respective targets, evaluated by predicted enzyme-inhibitor dissociation constant and root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) between predicted and experimental bound configurations, and we present a series of preferred parameters for use with these systems in the industry-standard surflex-dock screening program, for use by researchers utilizing in silico techniques to discover and optimize new scaffolds.	biology
cannibalism of the entire brood by mouthbrooding males was observed in the cardinal fish,apogon doederleini, in warm temperate waters of southern japan. this filial cannibalism always occurred within a day of spawning. males preferentially ate broods produced by females smaller than themselves and by non-resident females, and always changed mates after cannibalism. cannibalistic males re-mated more quickly than males whose broods were experimentally removed. these results indicate that cannibalistic males take advantage of multiple mate availability, by eating the first brood and rearing the second. it is suggested that filial cannibalism in this fish is associated with mating strategies of females that can shorten inter- spawning intervals by changing mates.	biology
feeding ecology of individually marked male and female herring gulls breeding at the colony of treberon (france) has been compared for two successive periods. during the first period (1983–1988), most of the breeders intensively used a nearby refuse tip which was the main feeding site of the colony. at the refuse tip. food supplies were more abundant and predictable than at the other available feeding sites. in the second period (1989–1990), an incinerator was running so that the amount of food dumped at the tip decreased by 80%. analysis of regurgitations showed sex differences in diet: females ate more earthworms and less garbage than males. during the period 1989–1990, the difference between the two sexes increased markedly. after the opening of the incinerator, the proportion of females seen at the tip diminished whereas the proportion of males did not change. the females which continued to use the tip were less often seen than the males. it is suggested that the differences between the foraging state...	biology
"individuals infected by the human immunodeficiency virus type (hiv-1) demonstrate progressive depletion and qualitative dysfunction of the helper t4 (cd4+) cell population. mechanisms proposed for attrition of cd4+ t cells include direct cytopathicity of these mature cells following infection as well as infection of early t-lymphocyte progenitors. the latter mechanism could lead to failure to regenerate mature functioning cd4+ t cells. the present study determines the susceptibility of thymocytes at various stages of maturity to infection with hiv-1. various normal thymocyte populations were inoculated with hiv-1, including unfractionated (uf), cd3- cd4- cd8- [""triple negative"" (tn)], cd4+ cd8+ [""double positive"" (dp)] thymocytes, and thymocyte populations obtained by limited dilution cloning. cultures were studied for the presence of hiv-1 dna by polymerase chain reaction in addition to examination for reverse transcriptase activity. we determined that transformed t-cell and thymocyte cell lines completely lacking cd4 were not susceptible to infection by hiv-1, whereas all of the following lines were: uf thymocytes (70-90% cd4hi+); dp thymocytes (99% cd4hi+); tn thymocytes (0% cd4hi+); and tcr alpha beta +, tcr gamma delta +, or cd16+ cd3- (natural killer) thymocyte clones expressing variable levels of cd4 and representing the progeny of tn thymocytes. [tcr alpha beta + and tcr gamma delta + refer to the chains of the t-cell antigen receptor (tcr), and cd4hi refers to a strong rightward shift (greater than linear channels) of the cd4 curve on flow cytometric analysis compared with control.] monoclonal antibodies (mabs) to cd4 (t4a epitope) but not to cd3 (t3) were capable of blocking infection of mature and immature cd4hi+ thymocytes. moreover, anti-cd4(t4a) mabs also inhibited infection of cd4hi- tn thymocytes, indicating that these t-cell precursors--despite their apparent ""triple negativity"" (cd3- cd4hi- cd8-)--expressed sufficient cd4 molecules to become infected. cell sorter analysis with a panel of cd4 mabs demonstrated a mean shift of the mean fluorescence channel (mfc) with cd4 mabs on tn thymocytes of +/- mfc units. thus, intrathymic t-cell precursors and their progeny representing many stages of t-cell ontogeny are susceptible to infection by hiv-1, including early tn thymocytes, which express very low levels of cd4. infection of multiple stages and multiple subsets of the t-cell lineage in man, mediated via the cd4 molecule, may explain the inability of the t-cell pool to regenerate in the setting of progressive hiv infection."	biology

brassinosteroids play diverse roles in plant growth and development. plants deficient in brassinosteroid (br) biosynthesis or defective in signal transduction show many abnormal developmental phenotypes, indicating the importance of both br biosynthesis and the signaling pathway in regulating these biological processes. recently, using genetics, proteomics, genomics, cell biology, and many other approaches, more components involved in the br signaling pathway were identified. furthermore, the physiological, cellular, and molecular mechanisms by which brs regulate various aspects of plant development, are being discovered. these include root development, anther and pollen development and formation, stem elongation, vasculature differentiation, and cellulose biosynthesis, suggesting that the biological functions of brs are far beyond promoting cell elongation. this review will focus on the up-to-date progresses about regulatory mechanisms of the br signaling pathway and the physiological and molecular mechanisms whereby brs regulate plant growth and development.	biology
the wt1 gene was analysed using dna from a wilms' tumour derived from a patient with the wagr syndrome using single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and polymerase chain reaction sequencing. a 14-bp insertion was found in the intron part of the splice donor site of exon and was a tandem duplication of an upstream exon sequence. this mutation would be expected to disrupt the correct processing of the wt1 mrna and is predicted to result in a non-functional protein. this observation further supports the role of wt1 in wilms' tumorigenesis in patients with constitutional 11p13 deletions.	biology
abstract type classification data from the holstein association of canada on 354,308 daughters of 13,694 sires were subdivided into groups of approximately equal size according to herd average final score. genetic and environmental variances were estimated for each group by henderson's new method. traits considered and their heritabilities averaged over groups were: final score .13; final class .11; dairy character .17; capacity .24; rump .16; feet and legs .10; mammary system .12; fore udder .12; rear udder .12; size .31. regressions of genetic variances on group number ordered according to herd final score indicated significant trends only for rump and feet and legs for which higher genetic variances were found for higher type scores. regressions of environmental variances on group number were significant for all traits. higher environmental variances were found for lower final scores, final class, dairy character, and capacity, but the opposite was observed for size. the distribution of environmental variances across groups was u-shaped for rump, feet and legs, fore udder, and rear udder; lowest variances were associated with intermediate scores for overall type.	biology

recent studies have indicated that lactoferrin may act as a cell mitogen. the effect of human and bovine lactoferrins on the proliferation and differentiation of a human intestinal epithelial cell line (caco-2) was investigated and compared with that of human transferrin. caco-2 cells were cultured in serum-free media supplemented with both iron-unsaturated and -saturated forms of the iron-binding proteins. cell proliferation and differentiation were evaluated by examining growth curves and measuring sucrase and alkaline phosphatase activities of brush border membrane fractions, respectively. the iron-binding status of lactoferrins and transferrin affected the proliferation of caco-2 cells. the iron-saturated forms of human (s-hlf), bovine (s-blf) lactoferrins and human transferrin (s-htf) enhanced cell proliferation, while iron-unsaturated forms (u-hlf, u-blf, and u-htf) suppressed it. iron-binding status also determined the effect of lactoferrin and transferrin on cellular differentiation, but this effect differed for different brush border enzymes. s-htf enhanced sucrase activity more than s-hlf or s-blf. both u-hlf and u-blf markedly suppressed sucrase activity. u-htf suppressed alkaline phosphatase activity appreciably, while the other iron-binding proteins showed no significant effect on it. lactoferrin and transferrin may modulate the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells, but their efficacy depends on their saturation with iron.	biology
the developmental pattern of the myelin-associated 5'-nucleotidase and its regulation by l-3,3',5,-triiodothyronine (t3) have been demonstrated in a culture system of cells dissociated from embryonic mouse brain. hypothyroid calf serum containing low levels of t3 (31 ng/100 ml), and thyroxine, t4 (less than microgram/ml), was used in the culture medium in place of normal calf serum (t3, ng/100ml; t4, 5.7 micrograms/ml) to render the cultures responsive to exogenously added t3. by means of t3 supplementation, the lower levels of enzyme activity observed in the cultures grown in the presence of hypothyroid calf-serum containing medium could be restored to a considerable extent although not completely to normal values. half-maximal stimulatory effect was obtained at 3.9 x 10(-8)m t3 concentration. among the various substrates tested, 5'-amp, 5'-ump and 5'-cmp were equally good, while 5'-gmp yielded approximately half the activity.	biology
abstract low-molecular-weight α-crystallin ( α l -crystallin) isolated from decapsulated lens of goat ( capra hiscus ) has been purified to an apparently homogeneous population. goat α l -crystallin closely resembles its bovine counterpart in size, shape, exposition of sulfhydryl groups, subunit composition and the nature of its uv-absorption profile. like bovine α l -crystallin, dissociated subunits of goat α l -crystallin assemble upon reassociation into a particle of almost half the size of the native one. however, subunits of goat α l -crystallin are found to contain more aromatic amino acid residues than those of bovine subunits leading to a higher value of extinction coefficient ( e cm 1% ) at nm for the goat protein.	biology
the photosynthetic behaviour and composition of photosynthetic pigments of four cosmarium strains collected from different geographic areas were examined under moderate and photoinhibitory white light by means of pam fluorometry and high-performance liquid chromatography. generally, all of the cosmarium strains displayed the photosynthetic performance and the composition of xanthophyll cycle pigments corresponding to that of high-light adapted plants and algae, when grown under the standard laboratory conditions. however, photoinhibitory treatments provoked several strain- and species-specific characteristics despite the long-term cultivation in laboratory conditions. the typical arctic taxon, c. crenatum var. boldtianum, displayed an incomplete violaxanthin cycle yielding an accumulation of antheraxanthin during high light stress, which is considered as an adaptation to occasional high irradiances in the polar zone due to the albedo. so far, the violaxanthin/antheraxanthin turnover was known only in some prasinophycean algae. antheraxanthin actively participated in the heat dissipation from psii centres in c. crenatum, as concluded from a significant positive correlation between non-photochemical quenching (npq) and the quantity of antheraxanthin. in contrast, all the other cosmarium strains displayed a complete violaxanthin de-epoxidase action during the high light treatments, as judged from the relatively high production of zeaxanthin which participated in thermal dissipation of excess energy.	biology
aspects of the reproductive biology of the common shrimp crangon crangon (l.) were studied in port erin bay, isle of man, irish sea. size at sexual maturity was determined from the proportions of ovigerous females and of females with maturing ovaries. the size at which 50% of females are mature is estimated (±95% confidence intervals) as 12.5±0.48 mm carapace length. based on the proportions of ovigerous females and of mature females, the main breeding season was from january to june. mean ovarian dry weights indicated two broods (winter and summer), with females bearing winter broods (wb) having higher gonad indices than those with summer broods (sb). wb females with non-eyed eggs and with eyed eggs differed in the regression of ovarian dry weight on carapace length, indicating preparation for laying a second brood. in both broods the moult stages of berried females were related to egg stage. moulting will occur following the release of the brood. during embryonic development, mean egg length and egg volume were larger in all stages, and the mean dry weight of individual eggs of all stages heavier, in wb than in sb; there was no difference in egg number, however. consequently, reproductive investment, the proportion of female weight devoted to egg production, was 67% higher in wb (0.20±0.04) than in sb (0.12±0.03). there is a significant effect of egg volume on brood weight, but not on egg number. in both broods, egg number was a negatively allometric function of female body size in non-eyed eggs and an isometric function of female body size in eyed eggs. brood mortality during incubation was higher in sb (17%) than wb (10%). differences in the reproductive variables and investment between the two broods of c. crangon are discussed in the light of reproductive strategies and life history.	biology
the chemokine cxcl12, via its receptor cxcr4, promotes increased survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) b cells that express high levels of ζ-chain–associated protein (zap-70), a receptor tyrosine kinase associated with aggressive disease. in this study, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms governing this effect. although significant differences in the expression or turnover of cxcr4 were not observed between zap-70+ and zap-70− cell samples, cxcl12 induced greater intracellular ca2+ flux and stronger and more prolonged phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) and mitogen-activated protein kinase/erk kinase (mek) in the zap-70+ cll cells. the cxcl12-induced phosphorylation of erk and mek in zap-70+ cll cells was blocked by sorafenib, a small molecule inhibitor of raf. furthermore, zap-70+ cll cells were more sensitive than zap-70− cll cells to the cytotoxic effects of sorafenib in vitro at concentrations that can readily be achieved in vivo. the data suggest that zap-70+ cll cells may be more responsive to survival factors, like cxcl12, that are elaborated by the leukemia microenvironment, and this sensitivity could be exploited for the development of new treatments for patients with this disease. moreover, sorafenib may have clinical activity for patients with cll, particularly those with zap-70+ cll.	biology
tissue cadmium and zinc levels in steller sea lions have been analysed to elucidate the body distribution of these metals and their age-related accumulation. a significant correlation between age (0.7–8.8 year old) and renal and hepatic cadmium concentration was noted. of the tissues examined, the kidney manifested the highest cadmium content (mean: 20.9 μg g−1 dry wt). a similar zinc distribution pattern was observed; its concentration was more uniform among tissues than that of cadmium. the tissue cadmium concentration in the steller sea lion was lower than in other pinnipeds from various areas, possibly due to their feeding habits which may represent a major pathway of metal accumulation.	biology
abstract the development of immunity to ostertagia ostertagi and cooperia oncophora and interactions between these species were investigated in experimentally infected calves. parasitological, serological and histological parameters were used for assessing immune responses. no conclusive evidence of an effect of c. oncophora on the course of an o. ostertagi infection in calves could be shown. following a challenge with c. oncophora and o. ostertagi of c. oncophora primed calves, no significant reductions in establishment rate, faecal egg counts, worm length or the percentage of early fourth stage larvae could be demonstrated. results also confirmed earlier work showing the very different degrees of immunity conferred following immunisation with either c. oncophora or o. ostertagi. while a protective immunity was generated in the case of c. oncophora, continuous infection of calves with l3 of o. ostertagi during almost months induced immune reactions which affected growth and fecundity of the worms but not the establishment rate.	biology
abstract the relative dna content (mg/g wet wt.) of the lizard liver declined sharply during postnatal stage remaining almost constant during the laterhalf of the life-span. the total dna (mg/whole liver wet wt.) was found to increase with increasing bodyweight. the relative rna content (mg/g wet wt.) reached the peak level at g body weight and declined thereafter. the total rna (mg/whole liver wet wt.) showed the same tendency as observed for total dna. the relative protein content (mg/g liver wet wt.) showed the highest concentration at about g bodyweight and remaining constant thereafter. when expressed on the basis of dna (mg protein/mg dna) the protein content also reached a peak level at about g body weight but showed decline thereafter. the total protein (mg/whole liver wet wt.) indicated a steady rise with increasing age but at much slower rate beyond g body weight. the rna/ dna ratio was highest at about g body weight and declined thereafter. the rna/protein ratio also showed the similar trend.	biology
trisomy is one of the most common trisomies in clinically recognized pregnancies and one of the few trisomies identified in liveborns, yet relatively little is known about the errors that lead to trisomy 13. accordingly, we initiated studies to investigate the origin of the extra chromosome in cases of trisomy 13. our results indicate that the majority of cases (>91%) are maternal in origin and, similar to other autosomal trisomies, the extra chromosome is typically due to errors in meiosis i. surprisingly, however, a large number of errors also occur during maternal meiosis ii ( approximately 37%), distinguishing trisomy from other acrocentric and most nonacrocentric chromosomes. as with other trisomies, failure to recombine is an important contributor to nondisjunction of chromosome 13.	biology
the floral units of triuridaceae, commonly regarded as flowers, may equally plausibly be interpreted as pseudanthia, i.e., modified and highly reduced partial inflorescences. this hypothesis is new for triuridaceae, but earlier authors have noted strong similarities between the inflorescences of cyclanthaceae and pandanaceae (pandanales) and the putatively pseudanthial floral units of some alismatales (e.g., potamogeton). the morphology of the floral units of triuridaceae, particularly the female and hermaphrodite structures, closely resembles a smaller version of a pandanus pistillate inflorescence. in some species of pandanus, the female flower consists of a single uniovulate carpel with a single stigma, as in triuridaceae. this striking morphological similarity is remarkable in the context of recent evidence from a single 18s nuclear rdna sequence for sciaphila that placed it as sister to pandanaceae within pandanales. however, because pseudanthia have been reported in both alismatales and pandanales, ...	biology
abstract it was reported that in fe-inefficient zea mays l. mutant yellow stripe ( ys1 ), unlike other plant species, the regulation of ferritin accumulation upon iron overload is controlled at the post-transcriptional level. we conducted similar experiments with another fe-inefficient maize mutant, yellow stripe ( ys3 ), affected in a different step of iron acquisition. uptake of iron by roots was followed in leaves of both mutant and wild type plants using ferritin mrna and protein accumulation. we can thus demonstrate that in maize the presence of iron controls ferritin synthesis at the transcriptional level. because of the difference in the response of ys1 and ys3 , we also postulate the presence of a second factor acting translationally, related to the level of ferrated phytosiderophore.	biology
natural killer (nk) cell activity, ok-432-augmented-nk cell activity, concentrations of interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) in the culture supernatants of lymphocytes stimulated with ok-432, and subsets of nk cells and memory t cells were analyzed in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) receiving maintenance chemotherapy. natural killer and augmented-nk cell activities, and concentrations of ifn-gamma in the supernatants of cultured lymphocytes, were significantly lower in the patients with all than in age-matched control children. among the nk cell subsets, proportions of cd57+ cells in the patients with all were significantly higher than in the controls, and proportions of a memory t cell subset (cd4+ cd29+ t cells) in the patients were also significantly higher than in the controls. these results suggest that the function of nk cells and memory t cells that are considered as ifn-gamma producing cells, may be defective in all, and that cd57+ cells and cd4+ cd29+ cells may be resistant to or recover rapidly from suppression by cytotoxic chemotherapy.	biology
cardiovascular disease, which accounts for the highest morbidity and mortality in the united states, has several major risk factors, including aging and diabetes. overweight and obesity, especially abdominal obesity, have been increasingly implicated as independent risk factors in the development of cardiovascular disease. metabolic and/or diabetic cardiomyopathy has been especially associated with excess body weight caused by chronic over-nutrition and high-fat feeding. in the initial stages, obesity is now understood to cause significant dysregulation of cardiac fatty acid and glucose metabolism. these abnormalities are due, in part, to increased oxidative stress, which in turn can cause deleterious effects on intracellular signaling pathways that control cellular growth and proliferation. this increase in oxidative stress is coupled with reduced anti-oxidant species and dysregulation of metabolic signaling pathways. the cardiomyopathy seen with obesity is associated with increased interstitial fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction. over time, evolving abnormalities include hypertrophy and systolic dysfunction, eventually leading to heart failure.	biology
this study investigated whether molecules spontaneously transported inside cells, like glucose derivatives, can also be used as electropermeabilization markers. uptake of a fluorescent deoxyglucose derivative (2-nbdg) by normal and electropermeabilized cells in culture was analyzed. 2-nbdg was added to dc-3f cell suspensions and cells, exposed or not to eight square-wave electric pulses of 100-μs duration and of appropriate field amplitude at a repetition frequency of hz or khz, were incubated at °c. 2-nbdg uptake was temperature-, concentration- and time-dependent in cells submitted or not to the electric pulses. in spite of significant uptake of 2-nbdg mediated by glut transporters into nonpermeabilized cells, the electric pulses significantly increased about ten to hundred times the 2-nbdg uptake into the cells. the increase in the field amplitude from to 1,500 v/cm resulted in a progressive increase of 2-ndbg. our results show that under the conditions of in vivo exposure duration to fdg and the physiological concentration of d-glucose, electric pulses increased 2-nbdg uptake into electropermeabilized cells. under our experimental conditions, the percentage of permeabilized cells within the population of cells exposed to electric pulses remained at the same level regardless of the pulse frequency used, hz or khz. the findings showed that glucose derivatives can also be used to detect electropermeabilized cells exposed to electric pulses.	biology
two-year old mallard ducks were exposed to prudhoe bay crude oil, corexit dispersant or a mixture of the two. percent hatching success, egg loss, and duckling survival were calculated for each clutch in the study. the absence of any differences among groups in general parental and incubation behavior, egg and nest temperatures, and duckling survival indicate that neither a light to moderate slick of undispersed oil or oil-corexit mixture nor corexit at a concentration up to ppm in the water can be expected to reduce breeding success through behavioral alteration. a supplemental test showed that bird oiling can be reduced by dispersing part of the surface oil into the water column.

abstractviral coat protein gene was detected in thirty isolates of different soil-borne fungi, using cotton leaf curl coat protein specific primers (geminiviruses). out of them, seven fungal isolates showed positive results (a band with a molecular size of bp). the products amplified from two isolates, macrophomina phaseolina (tassi) goid. and mucor racemosus bull., were excised from the gel, purified and sequenced. the sequence analysis revealed that the amplicons were coat protein genes of geminivirus. the gene isolated from m. phaseolina was similar to that of wheat dwarf geminivirus with identity not exceeding 36%; and the coat protein isolated from m. racemosus was 43% identical with the maize streak geminivirus. these low identities suggest that the amplification products belong to new records of geminiviruses designated (mpdv) and (mrdv), respectively. the isolate from m. racemosus was selected to investigate the viral transmission into the phytopathogenic fungus fusarium oxysporum schlecht. so...	biology
the content of the phospholipid metabolites, phosphocholine, phosphoethanolamine, glycerophosphorylcholine and glycerophosphorylethanolamine was measured in chemical extracts from human breast carcinoma using 31p nmr spectroscopy. some patients had received therapy prior to tumour resection. the data were therefore stratified into two groups: (i) all tumours; and (ii) untreated tumours. three indices of tumour proliferation i.e., mitotic index, ki67 and s-phase fraction were determined on tissue from the same tumours and were found not to correlate with the content of any of these metabolites. in addition oestrogen-receptor status and density, tumour grade and dna ploidy were obtained on some tumours. the phosphocholine content was higher in high grade tumours when compared with low grade tumours. there was no apparent relationship between dna ploidy and the content of any of these metabolites. glycerophosphorylcholine content of oestrogen-receptor positive tumours correlated with receptor density. however, there was no significant difference between receptor positive and negative tumours in the content of any of the phospholipid metabolites measured.	biology

lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced vascular endothelial cell (vec) dysfunction is an important contributing factor in vascular diseases. recently, we found that lps impaired vec by inducing autophagy. our previous researches showed that a butyrolactone derivative, 3-benzyl-5-((2-nitrophenoxy) methyl)-dihydrofuran-2(3h)-one (3bdo) selectively protected vec function. the objective of the present study is to investigate whether and how 3bdo inhibits lps-induced vec autophagic injury. our results showed that lps induced autophagy and led to increase of reactive oxygen species (ros) and decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential (mmp) in human umbilical vein vascular endothelial cells (huvecs). furthermore, lps significantly increased p8 and p53 protein levels and the nuclear translocation of p53. all of these effects of lps on huvecs were strongly inhibited by 3bdo. importantly, the ros scavenger n-acetylcysteine (nac) could inhibited lps-induced autophagy and knockdown of p8 by rna interference inhibited the autophagy, p53 protein level increase, the translocation of p53 into nuclei and the ros level increase induced by lps in huvecs. the data suggested that 3bdo inhibited lps-induced autophagy in huvecs through inhibiting the ros overproduction, the increase of p8 and p53 expression and the nuclear translocation of p53. our findings provide a potential tool for understanding the mechanism underlying lps-induced autophagy in huvecs and open the door to a novel therapeutic drug for lps-induced vascular diseases.	biology
"a novel pathway for physiological ""cross-talk"" between the insulin receptor and the regulatory gi-protein has been demonstrated. we tested the hypothesis that a coupling defect between gi and the insulin receptor is present in the liver of obese patients with and without type ii diabetes. insulin x 10(-9) m (approximately ed50) and x 10(-7) m (max) inhibited pertussis toxin-catalyzed adp ribosylation of gi in human liver plasma membranes from lean and obese nondiabetic patients. however, x 10(-7) m insulin was without effect in membranes from patients with type ii diabetes. this coupling defect was not intrinsic to gi, since mg2+ and gtp gamma s inhibited pertussis toxin-catalyzed adp ribosylation in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients. binding of insulin of the alpha-subunit and activation of the tyrosine kinase intrinsic to the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor are not responsible for the coupling defect. 125i insulin binding is the same in obese patients with or without diabetes. tyrosine kinase of the insulin receptor is decreased in diabetes. however, a monoclonal antibody to the insulin receptor (ma-20) at equimolar concentrations with insulin equally inhibits pertussis toxin-catalyzed adp ribosylation of gi without activating tyrosine kinase or insulin receptor autophosphorylation. immunodetection of g-proteins suggested that gi3 alpha was normal in diabetes and gi1-2 alpha was decreased by 40% in the diabetic group as compared to the obese nondiabetic group but was normal when compared to the lean non diabetic group. we conclude that the novel pathway of insulin signaling involving the regulatory gi proteins via biochemical mechanisms not directly involving the tyrosine kinase of the insulin receptor is altered in obese type ii diabetes and offers a new target for the search of the mechanism(s) of insulin resistance."	biology
the nucleotide sequence of a 4936-bp genomic dna fragment from the thermophilic bacterium thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus has been determined. the fragment contains three open reading frames (orfs). the product of the incomplete first orf is highly homologous to α-galactosidases (melibiases). the second orf corresponds to the laca gene for a thermostable β-galactosidase. the product of the third orf is similar to α-d-mannosidases. a putative ρ-independent terminator is located immediately downstream of the laca stop codon, suggesting a cotranscription of the α- and β-galactosidase genes. the deduced molecular weight of laca is kda. laca belongs to glycosylhydrolase family (gh2). native recombinant laca is a dimer and shows the highest activity at ph 5.7–6.0 and 75–80°c. laca is most active with lactose (480 units per mg protein, k m = mm); the activities with pnp-gal and onp-gal are and units per mg protein, respectively. immobilized on aldehyde silochrome, laca is even more thermostable and retains its high activity.	biology
"toroviruses are enteric viruses belonging to the nidovirales order that infect different animal species and humans. the lack of ""in vitro"" culture systems for toroviruses, except for the prototype berne virus or bev, isolated originally from an infected horse, has hampered their study and the development of diagnostic assays. this report describes a real time rt-pcr method to detect porcine torovirus (ptov) rna in clinical fecal samples using primers corresponding to the gene coding for the nucleocapsid protein which are conserved in all ptov strains known to date. this method can be used to determine viral loads allowing quantitation within a range between 10(1) and 10(8) genomic units per reaction tube. the assay was evaluated with rectal swabs from piglets from a spanish farm. nineteen out of animals were shedding virus at the time of sample collection, indicating a high incidence of ptov infection in this farm. this is the first report showing the presence of ptov in spain. the real time rt-pcr assay described in this report provides a rapid, highly sensitive, specific and reliable detection and quantitation method enabling future ptov epidemiological studies."	biology
insulin resistance is a major feature of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. this resistance appears to involve molecules, apart from the insulin receptor, that are capable of altering its function. previously, we reported that dermal fibroblasts from a female patient with insulin resistance and noninsulin-dependent diabetes produced an inhibitor of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity. we have now studied inhibitors in fibroblasts from four additional patients (one male and three females) with severe insulin resistance. although clinical features were diverse, these patients had in common normal fasting glucose values, with fasting and postprandial hyperinsulinemia. the fibroblast insulin receptor content was within the normal range, but both basal and insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity in fibroblast extracts were markedly decreased compared to those in extracts of fibroblasts from nondiabetic subjects. studies revealed that these fibroblasts contained a glycoprotein inhibitor of insuli...	biology
the stability and deletion-size-distribution profiles of leading strand (cag)(75) and (ctg)(137) trinucleotide repeat arrays inserted in the escherichia coli chromosome were investigated upon overexpression of the single-stranded dna-binding protein (ssb) and in mutant strains deficient for the sbccd (rad51/mre11) nuclease. ssb overexpression increases the stability of the (cag)(75) repeat array and leads to a loss of the bias towards large deletions for the same array. furthermore, the absence of sbccd leads to a reduction in the number of large deletions in strains containing the (ctg)(137) repeat array.	biology
neonicotinoids, such as imidacloprid, are key insecticides extensively used for control of nilaparvata lugens. however, imidacloprid resistance has been reported in many asian countries in recent years. to understand the roles of the chlorine atom of pyridyl group on insecticidal activity and resistance, the atom was removed to generate an imidacloprid analogue dc-imi (deschlorine imidacloprid). dc-imi showed significantly higher toxicity than imidacloprid in the susceptible strain of n. lugens, but had medium level cross-resistance in an imidacloprid-resistant strain. in xenopus oocyte expressed nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachrs) nlα1/rβ2, the inward currents evoked by dc-imi were detected and could be blocked by typical nachrs antagonist dihydro-β-erythroidine (dhβe), which demonstrated that dc-imi acted as an agonist on insect nachrs. the efficacy of dc-imi on nlα1/rβ2 was 1.8-fold higher than that of imidacloprid. in addition, the influence of an imidacloprid resistance associated mutation (y151s) on agonist potencies was evaluated. compared with the wild-type receptor, the mutation reduced maximal inward current of dc-imi to 55.6% and increased half maximal effective concentration (ec50 ) to 3.53-fold. compared with imidacloprid (increasing ec50 to 2.38-fold of wild-type receptor), y151s mutation decreased dc-imi potency more significantly. the results indicated that the selective and possibly high toxicities could be achieved through the modification of 6-chloro-3-pyridyl group in imidacloprid and other neonicotinoids.	biology
pulsatile release of gnrh-1 is critical to stimulate gonadotropes of the anterior pituitary. this secretory pattern seems to be inherent to gnrh-1 neurons, however, the mechanisms underlying such episodical release remain unknown. in monkey nasal explants, the gnrh-1 population exhibits synchronized calcium events with the same periodicity as gnrh-1 release, suggesting a link, though the sequence of events was unclear. gnrh-1 neurons in mouse nasal explants also exhibit synchronized calcium events. in the present work, gnrh-1 release was assayed in mouse nasal explants using radioimmunology and its relationship with calcium signaling analyzed. gnrh-1 neurons generated episodical release as early as d in vitro (div) and maintained such release throughout the period studied (3–21 div). the pulse frequency remained constant, suggesting that the pulse generator is operative at an early developmental stage. in contrast, pulse amplitude increased 2-fold between and div, and again between and div, sug...	biology
two female patients with functioning adrenocortical carcinomas had plasma acth detectable by ria at presentation. in both patients there was evidence for biological activity of acth. there was no evidence for an ectopic source of acth, nor for a pituitary tumour. urinary steroid analysis showed patterns of multiple hormone secretion characteristic of adrenocortical carcinomas. the finding of detectable acth concentrations in a patient with cushing's syndrome does not exclude the presence of an adrenocortical tumour.	biology
several different edible oils were compared for their ability to modify eicosanoid biosynthesis following experimentally-induced myocardial ischemia and reperfusion in the rat. two types of palm oil [neutralized, bleached, and deodorized (nbdpo) and refined, bleached, and deodorized (rbdpo)] and partially hydrogenated soybean oil (sbo) were tested against a diet supplemented with sunflower seed oil (sso) rich in n−6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa). fish oil (fo) rich in n−3 pufa, with its known cardioprotective actions, served as an internal reference point for the study. test oils were fed as a 12% (w/w) supplement for nine months before the induction of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. palm oil diets exerted effects indistinguishable from the sbo group against cardiac arrhythmia, which occurred following alterations to coronary blood flow. arrhythmic potentials, as expressed by a hierarchical scale (0–9) of arrhythmia score, were: sso, 1.5±0.5; fo, 0.9±0.4; sbo; 3.1±0.5*; nbdpo, 3.2±0.5*; rbdpo, 3.3±0.6*,* p<0.05 vs. sso. following ischemia and reperfusion, both sso and rbdpo groups tended to show an increase in myocardial prostacyclin, with the effect being more prominent in the rbdpo group (sso, 10%; rbdpo, 25%). thromboxane production was reduced in the fo group. interestingly, cardiac muscle from both fo and palm oil groups displayed a reduced capacity to produce 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid sso, 591.9±95.8; sbo, 375.5±48.9; nbdpo, 287.2±64.7*; rbdpo, 230.9±80.2**; fo, 203.7±81.4** (ng/g dry wt,* p<0.05,** p<0.01). no clear relationship was seen between the availability of 20∶4n−6 in myocardial phospholipids and eicosanoid profile. data suggests that fatty acid composition of edible oils is not the only determinant of arrhythmic vulnerability and eicosanoid production.	biology
abstract with the aim of gathering information about the possibility of culturing mussels ( mytilus galloprovincialis ) in a south mediterranean oligotrophic area, different lots of mussels were placed in culture at depths of −5 m and −15 m and their growth monitored on a monthly basis. temperature and salinity were measured in situ and water samples were collected at different depths each month. total suspended matter (tsm) and its inorganic (ism) and organic (osm) fractions were analysed by gravimetry and loss on ignition. photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll- a and phaeopigments), particulate organic carbon (poc) and nitrogen (pon), particulate carbohydrate (cho), protein (prt) and lipid concentration (lip) were also measured. the chlorophyll- a concentrations highlighted the high degree of oligotrophy of the study site. moreover, the inorganic fraction of total seston, which exceeded the organic fraction throughout the study period, highlighted the importance of the allochthonous input of suspended particles. two main phytoplankton abundance peaks were observed, in spring and autumn. these peaks were mirrored by the biochemical composition of the biopolymeric fraction of particulate organic matter (pom, the sum of prt, cho and lip concentrations). the relatively high values of the poc:pon ratio indicated that the major fraction of particulate organic matter in the study area was of detrital origin. a clear dilution effect on the organic matter, caused by high concentrations of suspended inorganic material, was also revealed by the lpom/tsm ratio, used as a qualitative food index. the mussels were found to activate physiological compensatory mechanisms in order to maintain a constant absorption rate of organic matter from the total available seston. in this case study, the mussels survived in an environment in which the quantities of available food were frequently time-varied. the mussels placed in culture as juveniles (total length=11.20±4.02 mm) reached a length of approximately mm after months, while the mussels placed in culture as sub-adults (total length=43.16±7.5 mm) reached the commercial size of about mm in the same time interval. the sub-adult mussels spawned in autumn and spring, indicating that they acclimatised well, despite the high degree of oligotrophy of the water.	biology
micrornas (mirnas) regulate the translational potential of their mrna targets and control many cellular processes. the key step in canonical mirna biogenesis is the cleavage of the primary transcripts by the nuclear rnase iii enzyme drosha. emerging evidence suggests that the mirna biogenic cascade is tightly controlled. however, little is known whether drosha is regulated. here, we show that drosha is targeted by stress. under stress, p38 mapk directly phosphorylates drosha at its n terminus. this reduces its interaction with digeorge syndrome critical region gene and promotes its nuclear export and degradation by calpain. this regulatory mechanism mediates stress-induced inhibition of drosha function. reduction of drosha sensitizes cells to stress and increases death. in contrast, increase in drosha attenuates stress-induced death. these findings reveal a critical regulatory mechanism by which stress engages p38 mapk pathway to destabilize drosha and inhibit drosha-mediated cellular survival.	biology
summary the equine herpes viruses strains (ehv) isolated from organs of aborted foetuses or from nasal swabs have been analysed by comparison of their restriction endonucleases patterns using two enzymes, bam hi and pst i. the majority of the clinical samples came from the west part of france (“normandie”) after abortions or respiratory disorders. all the viruses isolated were ehv-1 strains whose patterns show considerable homogeneity although some differences can be described. the genomic dnas of the same twenty strains have been digested by the pst i enzyme, which induced a great number of restriction fragments. it allows a more precise epidemiological study between strains isolated in the same studs with different bam hi patterns or between strains with identical bam hi profiles but with distinct respiratory or abortigenic pathogenicity. no strain isolated from aborted foetuses or nasal swabs presented the vaccinal pattern.	biology
abstract two species of marine actinosporeans with spores that develop in groups of fourrather than eight within a pansporocyst are described. in other respects, including triradialsymmetry, three polar capsules each enclosing a coiled polar filament, parasitic in invertebrates,they conform with other actinosporeans. both new species were found in the coelom of tubificidoligochaetes collected from moreton bay, queensland, australia. spores of tetrasporadiscoidea n.g. n.sp. are disc-like, almost round in apical view and dorso-ventrallycompressed in side view, whereas spores of tetraspora rotundum n.sp. are spherical.the novel development of these two marine actinosporeans may signify other variations in thelife-cycles of marine myxozoa.	biology
chronic ethanol intake is associated with sex hormone disturbances, and it is well known that melatonin plays a key role in regulating several reproductive processes. we report the effects of ethanol intake and melatonin treatment (at doses of μg/100 g bw/day) on sex hormones and steroid receptors in the ovaries, oviducts and uteri of ethanol-preferring rats. after days of treatment, animals were euthanized, and tissue samples were harvested to evaluate androgen, estrogen, progesterone and melatonin receptor subunits (ar, er-α and er-β, pra, prb and mt1r, respectively). melatonin decreased estradiol (e2) and increased progesterone (p4) and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (6-stm), while an ethanol-melatonin combination reduced both p4 and e2. ovarian ar was not influenced by either treatment, and oviduct ar was reduced after ethanol-melatonin combination. oviduct er-α, er-β and uterine er-β were down-regulated by either ethanol or melatonin. conversely, ovarian pra and prb were positively regulated by ethanol and ethanol-melatonin combination, whereas pra was down-regulated in the uterus and oviduct after ethanol consumption. mt1r was increased in ovaries and uteri of melatonin-treated rats. ethanol and melatonin exert opposite effects on e2 and p4, and they differentially regulate the expression of sex steroid receptors in female reproductive tissues.	biology
experiments are described in which the relative importance of head storage capacity and carbohydrate supply was examined in five sorghum varieties of different heights. the varieties were: namatera (270 cm), dobbs (180 cm), mus (100 cm), mus (85 cm) and mus (85 cm). techniques used were (i) cutting off part of the head or part of the leaf at anthesis, (ii) shading during different periods of development, and (iii) thinning the plants at different physiological stages. varietal differences ranged from a situation where the head was little more than half-filled by the available carbohydrate (mus 78), through intermediate stages (dobbs and namatera), to a situation where the head capacity limited the amount of carbohydrate which could be stored (mus and mus 70). some differences could be attributed to pre-anthesis competition between head and stem, but in the dwarfs a more important factor appeared to be pre-anthesis competition between head and leaf. it is suggested that for maximum efficiency of grain-yield production, maximum carbohydrate should be utilized for pre-anthesis head and leaf growth and that partitioning between these plant parts should be such that the supply of carbohydrate for grain filling is in balance with head storage capacity.	biology
a diallel arrangement, which incorporated the essential features of the de wit density replacement series, was employed to study the effects of competition amongst five genotypes of perennial ryegrass ( lolium perenne ). of the five genotypes concerned two were derived from s·24, two were collected from natural populations in south wales, while the remaining genotype originated from s· 23. these five genotypes were grown as monocultures and in all ten binary combinations. within each combination there were three mixture proportions, namely 75:25, 50:50 and 25:75. all mixtures and monocultures were represented by two boxes, one of which was cut at 3-week intervals (frequent cutting) the other being cut at 6-week intervals (infrequent cutting). at each cut all plants within the appropriate mixtures and monocultures were harvested individually and their dry weight recorded. the results obtained over the first weeks of the experiment (i. e. the first three complete growing periods) establish that competition is occurring in nine of the ten binary combinations. within these nine combinations competition may be classified into one of three groups: first, it may be compensatory, in which the gains and losses incurred by the two components counterbalance; secondly, it may be positive complete complementation, where the advantage gained by the stronger component is such that the mixture performance matches that of the better monoculture, and thirdly, it may be positive over-complementation, where the yield of the better monoculture is surpassed by the mixture. further tests disclose that a long-leaved s· genotype is the strongest competitor, while a short-leaved, prostrate, indigenous genotype proves to be by far the weakest competitor. estimates of the equilibrium proportions for each genotype combination suggest that most combinations are expected to become monocultures of the strongest component, with only the combination between the long-leaved indigenous and longleaved s· genotypes remaining a mixture at equilibrium. none of these equilibria coincides with the proportions required to achieve maximum productivity from a particular combination. the results are considered in relation to the known characteristics of these five perennial ryegrass genotypes, while the wider agronomic implications are also discussed.	biology
paperwhite narcissus of the tazetta group is one of the most important flower crops in israel, with more then million bulbs exported annually for both dry sales and flower production. recent releases by the volcani center (agricultural research organization) of cvs. ‘ariel’ and ‘inbal’, require adequate protocols for flowering manipulation and extending blooming prior to december and after january, as is common under ambient conditions in israel. flowering physiology, including intrabulb flower development, storage, and forcing methods of the new cultivars, were studied in comparison with cv. ‘ziva’. for september and october planting, bulb storage under ambient conditions (open shed) or at °c was followed by two weeks of chilling at or °c. post-harvest storage at °c enhanced intrabulb flower differentiation, and pre-planting chilling promoted intrabulb scape elongation, but scapes' final length were shorter then in the control. for january planting, bulbs were kept at °c with a co...	biology

conventional treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) has apparently reached a plateau of effectiveness in improving the survival of nsclc patients. although neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies in early stages are under investigation and some progress has been achieved in the management of locally advanced and advanced disease, treatment outcomes for nsclc are still to be considered dismal. the majority of patients affected from nsclc experience metastatic disease and optimization of chemotherapy is unlikely to produce further substantial survival improvement, with symptom relief and quality of life still being the primary goal of treatment. based on this background, clinical investigation of novel treatment strategies is mandatory. as our understanding of tumor cell biology has increased and several molecular targets for nsclc have been identified, a number of new biologic agents have been developed. targeted therapy describes treatment strategies that focus on cell signaling and other biologic pathways involved in tumorigenesis. several targeted agents have been introduced in clinical trials in nsclc, the majority in advanced disease, and some phase iii studies have already produced definitive results. currently, the minority of these new agents offer promise of improved outcomes and negative results are more common to be reported than positive ones. however, important lessons can be learned from this first generation of clinical trials that should be considered the first step of clinical research in this field.	biology
previous studies have shown that histone deacetylase (hdac6) plays critical roles in many cellular processes related to cancer. however, its biological roles in the development of melanoma remain unexplored. our aim was to investigate whether hdac6 has a biological role in human melanoma development and to understand its underlying mechanism. in the present study, hdac6 expression was up-regulated in melanoma tissues and cell lines. knockdown of hdac6 significantly inhibited the proliferation and colony formation ability of a375.s2 cells, promoted cell arrest at g0/g1 phase and apoptosis. additionally, western blotting assay showed that hdac6 silencing suppressed bcl-2 level and enhanced bax level, then activated caspase-9 and caspase-3, and further activated the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytoplasm, finally induced cell apoptosis involving the mitochondrial pathway. knockdown of hdac6 triggered a significant generation of ros and disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (mmp). furthermore, ros inhibitor, nac reduced hdac6 sirna-induced ros production, and blocked hdac6 sirna-induced loss of mmp and apoptosis. nac also significantly blocked hdac6 sirna-induced mtdna copy number decrease and mitochondrial biogenesis and degradation imbalance. in conclusion, the results showed that knockdown of hdac6 induced apoptosis in human melanoma a375.s2 cells through a ros-dependent mitochondrial pathway.	biology
we previously demonstrated that the oral antipsoriatic dimethylfumarate is an inhibitor of cytokine-induced adhesion molecule expression in endothelial huvec cells. we now report the inhibitory effect of dimethylfumarate on tumor-necrosis-factor-α- or interleukin-1α-induced intercellular adhesion molecule expression in normal human dermal fibroblasts. western blots of normal human dermal fibroblast cytoplasmic extracts showed that dimethylfumarate has minor effects on the iκbα, β and e proteins: their cytokine-induced degradation and resynthesis is only slowed down, an effect most prominently observed for iκbβ. no inhibitory effect of dimethylfumarate was observed on cytokine-induced rela/p65 or c-rel accumulation in nuclear extracts of cytokine-treated normal human dermal fibroblast cells. in contrast, cytokine-induced nuclear factor κb1/p50 nuclear accumulation was specifically inhibited by dimethylfumarate. this inhibitory effect on nuclear factor κb1 nuclear localization in normal human dermal fibroblasts proved sufficient to inhibit nuclear factor κb1-rela binding to nuclear factor κb consensus oligonucleotides in dna binding assays. likewise, cytokine-induced activation of a pnfκb::luciferase reporter construct in transiently transfected normal human dermal fibroblasts was inhibited by dimethylfumarate. the observations support a mechanistic model for the oral antipsoriatic dimethylfumarate in which lowering of nuclear factor κb1 leads to changes in the nuclear factor κb1-rela nuclear balance and inhibition of cytokine-induced adhesion molecule expression in normal human dermal fibroblasts.	biology
a cdna (m41) corresponding to a mouse myelin basic protein (mbp) mrna with a longer 5'-untranslated region than predicted from earlier studies of mbp gene structure has been isolated and characterized. the additional 5'-untranslated region is encoded by two previously unidentified exons upstream of the major transcription start site of the gene. using a dna probe specific for m41-mbp mrnas, northern blot analysis indicated that expression of this transcript follows a developmental course in mouse brain similar to that of the majority of mbp mrnas, but that the level of expression varies between brain and spinal cored. expression of mbp mrnas similar to the mouse m41-mbp also was identified in rat brain. the results suggest that the structure of the mbp gene is more complex than originally thought, containing at least two more exons. there appears to be at least one more mbp gene promoter that directs the synthesis of a subset of mbp mrnas with a unique 5'-untranslated region.	biology
mutant plays an important role in function analysis in plant. a rice flower mutantreproduce organs absent (roa), showing a stable inheritance during several years of study, was identified in rice (oryza sativa l.ssp. indica) cultivar jinhui10 treated with ems and used in this study. this mutant showed following: elongated palea and pedicle; absence of inner three whorls of floral organs; multi-whorls glume like organs inside the lemma/palea; spikelet meristem like organ upon the pedicle. these phenotypes suggested thatroa is a key gene in rice spikelet development. genetic analysis confirmed that the mutant traits were controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene. by gene mapping,roa was restricted between two ssr markers rm221 and rm1342 on the chromosome 2. it concluded thatroa was a novel gene involving in flower development in rice. besides, the mutation ofroa influenced the transcription level of floral homeotic genes; the expression of floral homeotic genes decreased in roa panicle compared with wild-type, and it suggested thatroa affected flower development by influencing the expression of floral homeotic genes.	biology
abstract polycytosine-binding proteins (pcbps) are rna-binding proteins that participate in post-transcriptional control pathways. among the diverse functions of these proteins is the interaction with a nucleotide pyrimidine-rich domain within the 3′utr of tyrosine hydroxylase (th) mrna. mutations to this domain result in decreased stability of th mrna and loss of camp-mediated activation of th mrna translation. pcbps are hypothesized to play key roles in these regulatory mechanisms. in order to further test this hypothesis, we examined the tissue distribution of pcbps in catecholaminergic cells. initial studies demonstrated that proteins from catecholaminergic tissues bind to th mrna 3′utr sequences and these proteins have an apparent mr of ∼44 kda, which is close to the molecular sizes for pcbps. fluorescent immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy was used to analyze the distribution of pcbp isoforms in th-positive cells of the rat midbrain, locus coeruleus, and adrenal gland. our results suggest that: (1) pcbp2 is the predominant isoform in th-positive cells of the rat midbrain; (2) pcbp3 is the predominant isoform in th-positive cells of the locus coeruleus; and (3) pcbp1 is the predominant isoform in the adrenal medulla. the localization of pcbp proteins to th-positive cells in these catecholaminergic tissues is consistent with the hypothesis that pcbps play a role in the regulation of th expression.	biology
an intriguing association between the spatial layout of chromosomes within nuclei and the evolution of chromosome gene order was recently uncovered. chromosome regions with conserved gene order in the drosophila genus are larger if they interact with the inner side of the nuclear envelope in d. melanogaster somatic cells. this observation opens a new door to understand the evolution of chromosomes in the light of the dynamics of the spatial layout of chromosomes and the way double-strand breaks are repaired in d. melanogaster germ lines. chromosome regions at the nuclear periphery in somatic cell nuclei relocate to more internal locations of male germ line cell nuclei, which might prefer a gene order-preserving mechanism to repair double-strand breaks. conversely, chromosome regions at the nuclear periphery in somatic cells keep their location in female germ line cell nuclei, which might be inaccessible for cellular machinery that causes gene order-disrupting chromosome rearrangements. thus, the gene order stability for genome regions at the periphery of somatic cell nuclei might result from the active repair of double-strand breaks using conservative mechanisms in male germ line cells, and the passive inaccessibility for gene order-disrupting factors at the periphery of nuclei of female germ line cells. in the present article, i find evidence consistent with a dna break repair-based differential contribution of both d. melanogaster germ lines to the stability/disruption of gene order. the importance of germ line differences for the layout of chromosomes and dna break repair strategies with regard to other genomic patterns is briefly discussed.	biology
the family of heavy metal-sequestering peptides with the formula (γ-glu-cys)ngly; n = 2–8), the phytochelatins (pcs), are not restricted to higher plants. in schizosaccharomyces pombe the occurrence of two of these peptides has previously been reported. reinvestigation of the peptide pattern of the heavy metal-exposed fission yeast led to the discovery of five additional peptides, a pattern which now corresponds qualitatively exactly to the one in higher plants. from the kinetics of induction we propose that pcs are synthesized by consumption of glutathione or its biosynthetic precursor.	biology
the human il-1 family contains eleven genes encoded at three separate loci. nine, including il-36 receptor antagonist (il-36rn), also known as il-1f5, are present at a single locus on chromosome whereas il-18 and il-33 lie on chromosomes and respectively. there are currently only three known orthologues in the chicken - il-1β, il-18 and il-1rn - which are encoded on chromosomes and unplaced, respectively. a novel chicken il-1 family sequence representing il-36rn (il-1f5) was initially identified from an expressed sequence tag (est) library by its similarity to both chicken il-1rn and chicken il-1β. following isolation of the cdna from the liver of an uninfected bird, a number of unique sequence features were identified. the predicted protein has a longer nh(2)-terminus than the human protein; however, as in mammals, this region contains neither a prodomain nor a signal peptide. a putative nuclear export sequence is also apparent, yet a similar motif is absent in mammalian il-36rn. although chil-36rn exhibits low homology with its mammalian orthologues, it encodes a predicted β-trefoil structure whose β-strands are conserved with those of the mouse sequence. unlike in mammals, chil-36rn expression was constitutive in all tissues and cell subsets examined. in response to viral infection, expression was significantly downregulated in a line of birds which are susceptible to the virus. chicken il-36rn, like chil-1rn, is not encoded at the chil-1β locus, further emphasising the genomic fragmentation of the large il-1 gene cluster found in mammals. this suggests differential evolution of this cytokine family since the divergence of birds and mammals from a common ancestor, and underlines the difficulty of determining the full repertoire of chil-1 family members.	biology
bcl-2 family proteins including the pro-apoptotic bh3-only proteins are central regulators of apoptotic cell death. here we show by a focused sirna miniscreen that the synergistic action of the bh3-only proteins bim and bmf is required for apoptosis induced by infection with neisseria gonorrhoeae (ngo). while bim and bmf were associated with the cytoskeleton of healthy cells, they both were released upon ngo infection. loss of bim and bmf from the cytoskeleton fraction required the activation of jun-n-terminal kinase-1 (jnk-1), which in turn depended on rac-1. depletion and inhibition of rac-1, jnk-1, bim, or bmf prevented the activation of bak and bax and the subsequent activation of caspases. apoptosis could be reconstituted in bim-depleted and bmf-depleted cells by additional silencing of antiapoptotic mcl-1 and bcl-xl, respectively. our data indicate a synergistic role for both cytoskeletal-associated bh3-only proteins, bim, and bmf, in an apoptotic pathway leading to the clearance of ngo-infected cells.	biology

several nitrogen compounds were identified and quantified in the apoplastic and symplastic sap of sugarcane stems. the sap of stems was composed mainly of soluble sugars, which constituted 95% of the total organic compounds detected. sap also contained nitrogen compounds, with amino acids (50-70% of n) and proteins (20-30% of n), being the main nitrogenous substances, as well as inorganic forms as ammonium, nitrite and nitrate, in low concentrations (<20% of n). serine, proline, alanine and aspartic acid together represented around 60% of the amino acids of the sap of both field grown and high nitrogen fertilized plants, and non-nitrogen fertilized plants inoculated with gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus. the total amino acid content of apoplastic sap was six to nine times lower in non-nitrogen fertilized plants than in fertilized ones. the possible roles of these substances to regulate endophytic associations with sugarcane are also discussed.	biology
cultured arterial smooth muscle cells go through a transition from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype. morphologically, the transition includes a reduction in size of the myofilament bundles and the formation of an extensive rough endoplasmic reticulum and a large golgi complex. functionally, it leads to loss of contractility, onset of cellular proliferation, and secretion of extracellular matrix components. this change in differentiated characteristics under in vitro conditions has attracted attention because of its resemblance to the modification of the smooth muscle cells that occurs in vivo during atherogenesis. here, transmission electron microscopy and [3h]-thymidine autoradiography were used to study the role of calcium ions in the control of phenotypic properties and growth of cultivated rat aortic smooth muscle cells. the calcium antagonist nisoldipine was found to lack distinct effect on the structural reorganization of the cells, but showed a moderate prohibitory effect on the start of dna synthesis early in primary culture. in growth-arrested secondary cultures, nisoldipine inhibited induction of dna synthesis by serum or platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf). the agent's effect was inversely related to the concentration of calcium ions in the extracellular medium and was partially counteracted by the calcium agonist bay k 8644. in contrast, w-7, an antagonist of the calcium-binding protein calmodulin, potentiated the effect of nisoldipine and, at higher concentrations, inhibited induction of dna synthesis in itself. the results suggest that the mitogenic stimulation of arterial smooth muscle cells involves a flux of calcium ions through the plasma membrane and requires participation of calmodulin.	biology

abstract seasonal changes in the level and composition of nematode burdens in young sheep during their first year were studied in successive lamb crops over a 3‐year period. post‐mortem worm count data were obtained from groups of lambs slaughtered at 28‐day intervals throughout each of the years. eighteen nematode species were recorded—14 strongylidae, trichinellidae, metastrongylidae, and rhabditidae. seasonal patterns of infection by most species were relatively constant during the period of study. peak infections of nematodirus occurred in the spring. of the principal trichostrongyle species, the patterns of infection by haemonchus contortus, ostertagia spp., trichostrongylus spp. of the small intestine, and chabertia ovina presented similarities; infections rose rapidly to a peak in late summer/early autumn, followed by an abrupt decline to low numbers in winter. duration of infection by these species was similar. infection by cooperia curticei and t. axei extended over a longer period and...	biology
hairpin rna-based rna interference (hprnai) has become a powerful tool for exploring gene function in reverse genetics. although, several methods are available for making constructs that express hprnai, multiple time-consuming cloning steps are usually involved. here, we introduce an efficient and flexible hprnai vector construction method via the isothermal in vitro recombination system (ir-hprnai). for an ir-hprnai reaction, two pcr products of a target gene sequence are generated, which contains complementary ends (~20 bp) to each other and to the ends of linearized vector, are fused in a way of head-to-head or tail-to-tail into the vector. this ir-hprnai method offers two options to construct the rnai vectors. using this method, we created a ir-hprnai construct for the arabidopsis pds3 gene,and verified the silencing effect via agrobacterium-mediated transformation. the ir-hprnai system rules out the requirement of engineering restriction enzyme cutting sites in target dna fragments, and is ligation-independent. thus, this method has advantages over the other hprnai construction methods.	biology
abstract in this study, we analyzed if il-22 displays, similar to other il-10 like cytokines such as il-28a, antiviral properties in hepatic cells. using rt-pcr and immunoblotting, we demonstrated that hepatic cell lines and primary hepatocytes express the functional il-22 receptor complex consisting of il-22r1 and il-10r2. hepatic il-22 mrna expression as measured by quantitative pcr was up-regulated in autoimmune and viral hepatitis compared to cholestatic liver diseases, while il-22 serum levels did not differ significantly between patients with viral hepatitis and normal controls. il-22 did not significantly change the expression levels of ifn-α/-β and of the antiviral proteins mxa and 2′,5′-oas. consequently, it had in comparison to ifn-α no relevant antiviral activity in in vitro models of hcv replication and infection. taken together, hepatic il-22 expression is up-regulated in viral hepatitis but il-22 does not directly regulate antiviral proteins and has, in contrast to ifn-α, no effect on hcv replication.	biology
a genetic circuit to suppress the lateral spread of cloned genes from recombinant to indigenous microorganisms in the environment has been developed. it is based on the endonucleolytic activity of the bacterial toxin colicin e3, which has a distinct target at the 3' end of the 16s ribosomal rna; this sequence is conserved in virtually all prokaryotic and many eukaryotic genera. cleavage at this sequence separates the mrna binding sites from the remainder of the 16s rrna, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. while host bacteria carrying the genes for both colicin production and colicin immunity are perfectly viable, lateral transfer of the e3 gene to non-immune recipients results in killing of such recipients. this genetic circuit decreases operational transfer frequencies of cloned genes linked to the e3 gene among a variety of bacterial genera by four to five orders of magnitude. in combination with transposon cloning vectors, the circuit is predicted to reduce the rate of lateral spread of specific genes to ecologically insignificant levels. this system therefore represents a useful tool both to explore the evolutionary and ecological consequences of experimentally reducing lateral gene spread among microorganisms, and to increase the ecological predictability of novel recombinant microorganisms.	biology
igg subclasses were determined quantitatively in sera from egyptian men who were infected with schistosoma mansoni. total and antigen-specific igg was measured pre- and post-treatment. total igg subclass antibodies were determined by immunoradiometric assay (irma) using monoclonal antibodies (moabs). the anti-worm and anti-egg specific s. mansoni igg subclass antibodies were quantitatively measured by elisa using specific moabs and standards obtained by affinity chromatography. our data show that total igg of the patients was elevated in the range of two to three times above normal. the magnitude of increase differed markedly among the four subclasses of igg. the igg1, igg2 and igg3 concentrations were approximately two to four times higher than normal, whereas the igg4 concentrations was times normal (9000 mg/l). igg1 and igg4 tended to dominate the igg subclass distribution of anti-soluble worm antigen preparation (swap) antibodies followed by igg2 and igg3. on the other hand, igg1 and igg2 dominated the igg subclass distribution of anti-soluble egg antigen (sea) antibodies. as with igg1, igg2 and igg3, most igg4 was non-specific. the role of igg subclasses in the pathogenesis of schistosomiasis is not clear. however, the high concentration of igg4 might act as ige blocking antibody, possibly as anti-idiotypes that may play a role in down-regulation of the immune system when it is challenged with an excess of antigen.	biology
genetic selection provides an effective way to obtain active catalysts from a diverse population of protein variants. we have used this tool to investigate the role of loop sequences in determining the quaternary structure of a domain-swapped enzyme. by inserting random loops of four to seven residues into a dimeric chorismate mutase and selecting for functional variants by genetic complementation, we have obtained and characterized both monomeric and hexameric enzymes that retain considerable catalytic activity. the low percentage of active proteins recovered from these selection experiments indicates that relatively few loop sequences permit a change in quaternary structure without affecting active site structure. the results of our experiments suggest further that protein stability can be an important driving force in the evolution of oligomeric proteins.	biology
background: panax ginseng c. a. meyer, a perennial herb from the araliaceae family, is a commonly used medicinal plant. many studies have been conducted on the biologically active constituents of whole parts of p. ginseng (i.e., roots, leaves, flower buds, and fruits). however, the seeds of p. ginseng have not been intensively investigated. a new sterol glucoside,3-o-β-d-glucopyranosyl-5,22,24-stigmastatrienol ( ), and a known sterol, 5,22-stigmastadienol ( ),were isolated from seeds of p. ginsengand were evaluated for their inhibitory activities on tumor necrosis factor (tnf)α-induced nuclear factor (nf)-κb and inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) transcription in transfected hepg2 cells. the present work deals with the isolation, identification, and antiinflammatory activities of the two compounds. materials and methods: the compounds were isolated by a combination of silica gel and ymc r-18 column chromatography, and their structures were identified by analysis of spectroscopic data (1d, 2d-nmr, and ms).the antiinflammatory activities of the isolated compounds and were evaluated by luciferase reporter gene assays. results: two sterols have been isolated from the seeds of p. ginseng. compound is a previously unreported glucosidyl sterol. compounds and both inhibited nfκb-luciferase activity, with ic values of 8.1 and 4.8΅m, respectively. they also inhibited inos-luciferase activity in tnfα-induced hepg2 cells, with ic values of 2.2 and 2.9΅m, respectively. conclusion: the two isolatedsterols have inhibitory effects on inflammation-related factors in hepg2 cells, as determined by luciferase reporter gene assays. thus, seeds of p. ginseng are worthy of consideration for the development and research of antiinflammatory agents.	biology
premetamorphic flounder larvae were administered different doses of 9-cis retinoic acid (9cra). 9cra at nm (the highest dose) not only stimulated adult-type (ad-) chromatophore development on the ocular (eyed) side, but also induced the development of ad-chromatophores on the blind (non-eyed) side of the metamorphosed fish. the ad-chromatophore development was stimulated by 9cra only when administered to the larvae that were at late premetamorphosis and at early prometamorphosis. ad-chromatophores actually appear much later, at the end of metamorphosis. 9cra was not effective at later stages of metamorphosis. these results suggest that 9cra stimulated the development or determination of the developmental fate of neural crest cells for chromatophores. the present results also suggest the presence of immature chromatophores or neural crest cells on both sides of the larval body of the flounder and that the ad-chromatophore development is somehow inhibited on the blind side in spontaneous metamorphosis. all-trans retinoic acid (atra) had a similar effect on the ad-chromatophore development. in addition, both types of ras affected the development of fin rays of the fish, resulting in deformity of fins when administered at high doses early in metamorphosis. the teratogenic effect of atra was greater than that of 9cra. j. exp. zool. 284:317–324, 1999. © wiley-liss, inc.	biology
myristicin, a methylenedioxyphenyl (mdp)-containing phenylpropene constituent of the leaves of many plants in the family umbelliferae, is a highly effective synergist of the cooccurring furanocoumarin xanthotoxin. as little as 0.10 % in an artificial diet can increase the toxicity of xanthotoxin toheliothis zea (lepidotera: noctuidae) fivefold. in addition to increasing the proportion of caterpillars dying at a given xanthotoxin concentration, myristicin also increases the rate at which they die and increases the time to molt of surviving larvae. that there was no increase in the deterrency of xanthotoxin in the presence of myristicin suggests that the mechanism of synergism is not behaviorial but rather is biochemical, via mdp competitive inhibition of microsomal mixed function oxidases.	biology
mutations in human cationic trypsinogen cause hereditary pancreatitis by altering its proteolytic regulation of activation and degradation by chymotrypsin c (ctrc). ctrc stimulates trypsinogen autoactivation by processing the activation peptide to a shorter form, but also promotes degradation by cleaving the calcium-binding loop in trypsinogen. mutations render trypsinogen resistant to ctrc-mediated degradation and/or increase processing of the activation peptide by ctrc. here we demonstrate that the activation peptide mutations d19a, d22g, k23r and k23_i24insidk robustly increased the rate of trypsinogen autoactivation, both in the presence and absence of ctrc. degradation of the mutants by ctrc was unchanged, and processing of the activation peptide was increased fourfold in the d19a mutant only. surprisingly, however, this increased processing had only a minimal effect on autoactivation. the tetra-aspartate motif in the trypsinogen activation peptide binds calcium (kd of ~ 1.6 mm), which stimulates autoactivation. unexpectedly, calcium binding was not compromised by any of the activation peptide mutations. despite normal binding, autoactivation of mutants d22g and k23_i24insidk was not stimulated by calcium. finally, the activation peptide mutants exhibited reduced secretion from transfected cells, and secreted trypsinogen levels were inversely proportional with autoactivation rates. we conclude that d19a, d22g, k23r and k23_i24insidk form a mechanistically distinct subset of hereditary pancreatitis-associated mutations that exert their effect primarily through direct stimulation of autoactivation, independently of ctrc. the potentially severe clinical impact of the markedly increased autoactivation is offset by diminished secretion, resulting in a clinical phenotype that is indistinguishable from typical hereditary pancreatitis.	biology
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachrs) are pentameric ligand-gated cation channels well characterized in neuronal signal transmission. moreover, recent studies have revealed nachr expression in nonneuronal cell types throughout the body, including tissues involved in metabolism. in the present study, we screen gene expression of nachr subunits in pancreatic islets and adipose tissues. mice pancreatic islets present predominant expression of α7 and β2 nachr subunits but at a lower level than in central structures. characterization of glucose and energy homeostasis in α7β2nachr(-/-) mice revealed no major defect in insulin secretion and sensitivity but decreased glycemia apparently unrelated to gluconeogenesis or glycogenolysis. α7β2nachr(-/-) mice presented an increase in lean and bone body mass and a decrease in fat storage with normal body weight. these observations were associated with elevated spontaneous physical activity in α7β2nachr(-/-) mice, mainly due to elevation in fine vertical (rearing) activity while their horizontal (ambulatory) activity remained unchanged. in contrast to α7nachr(-/-) mice presenting glucose intolerance and insulin resistance associated to excessive inflammation of adipose tissue, the present metabolic phenotyping of α7β2nachr(-/-) mice revealed a metabolic improvement possibly linked to the increase in spontaneous physical activity related to central β2nachr deficiency.	biology
the mucorales consist of both homothallic and heterothallic species. both types can be found in the same species but this is not a common phenomenon. a few homothallic strains are found in the predominantly heterothallic species, mucor pusillus . it was interesting to see how readily homothallic mutants could be induced in this species. spores of cbs 253.53(+) were irradiated with gamma rays. homothallic and (−) mutants were isolated. an albino (+) and a yellowish-brown (+) mutant were also found. the two pigment mutants were further mutated, and again both (−) and homothallic mutants were isolated. morphological characteristics of m. pusillus such as branching of sporangiophores, size of sporangia, and height of turf are retained by the mutants. the only obvious change is the color of the pigment of some of them. like the original strain, they grow in the absence of thiamine. the development, structure, and size of the zygospores are typical of m. pusillus . the dark pigment of the zygospores is lacking in the albino homothallic and in crosses between albino (+) and albino (−), but in all other cases the characteristic color is retained. homothallic mutants which otherwise are identical to their parent are readily induced by mutation of a heterothallic strain. the mere presence or absence of zygospores cannot be used as a classification criterion in this species which contains both hetero- and homothallic members.	biology

background n-glycolylneuraminic acid (neu5gc) is generated by hydroxylation of cmp-neu5ac to cmp-neu5gc, catalyzed by cmp-neu5ac hydroxylase (cmah). however, humans lack this common mammalian cell surface molecule, neu5gc, due to inactivation of the cmah gene during evolution. cmah is one of several human-specific genes whose function has been lost by disruption or deletion of the coding frame. it has been suggested that cmah inactivation has resulted in biochemical or physiological characteristics that have resulted in human-specific diseases. methodology/principal findings to identify differential gene expression profiles associated with the loss of neu5gc expression, we performed microarray analysis using illumina mouseref-8 v2 expression beadchip, using the main tissues (lung, kidney, and heart) from control mice and cmp-neu5ac hydroxylase (cmah) gene knock-out mice, respectively. out of a total of 25,697 genes, and genes were found to be significantly modulated in the lung, kidney, and heart tissues of the cmah null mouse, respectively. in this study, we examined the gene expression profiles, using three commercial pathway analysis software packages: ingenuity pathways analysis, kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes analysis, and pathway studio. the gene ontology analysis revealed that the top biological processes of these genes included protein metabolism and modification, signal transduction, lipid, fatty acid, and steroid metabolism, nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism, immunity and defense, and carbohydrate metabolism. gene interaction network analysis showed a common network that was common to the different tissues of the cmah null mouse. however, the expression of most sialytransferase mrnas of hanganutziu-deicher antigen, sialy-tn antigen, forssman antigen, and tn antigen was significantly down-regulated in the liver tissue of cmah null mice. conclusions/significance mice bearing a human-like deletion of the cmah gene serve as an important model for the study of abnormal pathogenesis and/or metabolism caused by the evolutionary loss of neu5gc synthesis in humans.	biology
background/aims the aim of this study was to investigate the effect and the mechanism of hyperbaric oxygen treatment on regenerating rat liver after partial hepatectomy (ph). methods wistar rats underwent a 70% ph, followed by treatment with hyperbaric oxygen starting 8h after ph. the regenerated liver weight and serum parameters were compared. proliferation of both hepatocytes and sinusoidal endothelial cell (sec) was also monitored by evaluating the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna) labeling index. furthermore, the hepatic adenosine triphosphate levels and vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) protein expression were analyzed at different times. results hyperbaric oxygen treatment significantly reduced the serum alanine aminotransferase levels at 24h, total bilirubin and total bile acid levels at and 72h, respectively. no significant differences in the hepatic adenosine triphosphate levels, the restitution of liver weight, or pcna positive hepatocytes were observed between the two groups. the pcna positive sec, in contrast, was significantly increased in the hyperbaric oxygen group at 48h, furthermore, the hyperbaric oxygen treatment significantly increased the expression of vegf protein in the regenerating liver at and 48h. conclusions hyperbaric oxygen treatment can be considered as a therapeutic modality after massive ph.	biology
abstract platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor was previously identified as the sole angiogenic activity present in platelets; it is now known to be thymidine phosphorylase (tp). the effect of tp on [methyl-3h]thymidine uptake does not arise from de novo dna synthesis and the molecule is not a growth factor. despite this, tp is strongly angiogenic in a rat sponge and freeze-injured skin graft model. neutralizing antibodies and site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that the enzyme activity of tp is a condition for its angiogenic activity. the level of tp was found to be elevated in human breast tumors compared to normal breast tissue (p < 0.001). overexpression of tp in mcf-7 breast carcinoma cells had no effect on growth in vitro but markedly enhanced tumor growth in vivo. these data and the correlation of expression in tumors with malignancy identify tp as a target for antitumor strategies.	biology
the aromatic amino acid l-tyrosine is used as a dietary supplement and has promise as a valuable precursor compound for various industrial and pharmaceutical applications. in contrast to chemical production, biotechnological methods can produce l-tyrosine from biomass feedstocks under environmentally friendly and near carbon-free conditions. in this minireview, various strategies for synthesizing l-tyrosine by employing biocatalysts are discussed, including initial approaches as well as more recent advances. whereas early attempts to engineer l-tyrosine-excreting microbes were based on auxotrophic and antimetabolite-resistant mutants, recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid technology and a vastly increasing knowledge of bacterial physiology allowed recently for more targeted genetic manipulations and strain improvements. as an alternative route, l-tyrosine can also be obtained from the conversion of phenol, pyruvate, and ammonia or phenol and serine in reactions catalyzed by the enzyme tyrosine phenol lyase.	biology

glia in the brain respond to various toxins with an increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) and an increased production of nitric oxide (no). here, we report that lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced expression of inos was down-regulated post-transcriptionally through the destabilization of inos mrna by the indolocarbazole compound, go6976, in murine microglia. this go6976 effect is specific for inos since tumor necrosis factor α was unaffected by the compound. interestingly, the post-transcriptional effects ascribed to go6976 were not observed with other inhibitors of protein kinase a, c (pkc), g, or protein tyrosine kinases. instead, these kinases appear to affect the inos/no system at the transcriptional level. in the past, go6976 has been reported to be a rather specific inhibitor of pkc in vitro. results from our experiments, through prolonged treatment with phorbol esters and with the various pkc inhibitors including phorbol ester-insensitive pkc isotype inhibitor, suggest that the go6976-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of inos gene expression and no production in microglia is not mediated through its reputed effects on pkc activity. since the effects of various neurotoxins and certain neurodegenerative diseases may be manifested through alterations in the inos/no system, post-transcriptional control of this system may represent a novel strategy for therapeutic intervention.	biology
the sponge eunapius fragilis (leidy), that has become abundant in southwestern lake michigan, overgrows zebra mussels, dreissena polymorpha (pallas). the overgrown mussels die. population dynamics show that in the presence of zebra mussels, e. fragilis is the dominant species (61% of sponges), with 90% of these sponges being associated directly to the mussels. in vivo p nmr spectroscopy performed on overgrown mussels reveals that mussel atp is depleted in a manner indicative of a tissue in anoxia (figure 2). p nmr phospholipid profiles reveal that the phospholipids of such mussels have been degraded to their lyso-phospholipid forms. phospholipid degradation may be the direct result of the lysosomal chemical action of the sponge or a secondary effect resulting from sponge-induced death by anoxia followed by microbial action on the weakened energy-depleted mussels.	biology
chemical studies on the constituents of dracaena cochinchinensis led to the discovery of eight new flavonoid derivatives ( 1- 8) along with known compounds ( 9- 22). the identification and structural elucidation of these isolates were based on spectral analyses. all isolates were tested for antibacterial activities against helicobacter pylori (atcc43504) and thrombin inhibitory effects. as a result, new flavonoid derivatives and and (2 s)-4',7-dihydroxy-8-methylflavan ( 11) were found to be most efficacious against h. pylori (atcc43504) with mic values of 29.5, 29.5, and 31.3 microm, respectively, and the seven new flavonoid derivatives ( 1- 7) and one known biflavonoid ( 9) were observed to exhibit moderate thrombin inhibitory activity.	biology

kit ligand (kl), a product of granulosa cells in ovarian follicles, is a putative regulator of oocyte development. however, the factors that regulate kl mrna levels in granulosa cells remain unclear. this study tested the hypothesis that oocytes regulate granulosa cell steady-state kl mrna expression levels and that the characteristics of this regulation are dependent on the stage of growth and development of both oocytes and follicles. levels of mrna for the kl splice variants (kl-1 and kl-2) were shown to be high in granulosa cells from preantral follicles and then decline after follicular antrum formation. preovulatory follicular development was associated with a dramatic increase in steady-state levels of kl-1 mrna in mural granulosa but not cumulus cells. regulation of these changes was examined in vitro using partly grown oocytes isolated from preantral follicles and fully grown oocytes isolated from preovulatory follicles. fsh increased the steady-state kl mrna levels in preantral granulosa cells in vitro. partly grown oocytes either increased or decreased kl mrna levels in preantral granulosa cells depending on the absence or presence of fsh stimulation, respectively. fully grown oocytes reduced the kl mrna level in preantral granulosa cells and increased the ratio of kl-1 to kl-2 mrna. in mural granulosa cell culture, fsh augmented testosterone-dependent elevation of the steady-state kl mrna level, but had no effect alone. fully grown oocytes reduced kl-2 but not kl-1 mrna levels in mural granulosa cells treated with testosterone plus fsh, whereas fully grown oocytes reduced levels of both kl transcripts in cumulus cell culture. these effects of oocytes on steady-state kl mrna expression levels in vitro explain the changes in granulosa cell kl mrna levels observed during follicle development in vivo. the results therefore support the hypothesis that oocytes regulate granulosa cell kit ligand mrna levels in a way that is characteristic of the stage of growth and development of the oocyte. moreover, the results suggest that oocytes play a major role in promoting dynamic changes in gene expression by granulosa cells appropriate to the stage of follicular development.	biology
we observe that paracentrotus lividus rna polymerase ii can form stable complexes with homologous dna at sites from which it can start rna synthesis in vitro. the sea-urchin genome can therefore be described in terms of the distribution of the dna sites that form such stable complexes with the homologous rna polymerase ii [class a sites as defined in a prokaryotic homologous system by d. hinkle and m. j. chamberlin (1972) j. mol. biol. 157-185]. we describe the properties of the complexes that p. lividus rna polymerase ii forms with p. lividus dna: resistance to heparin, dissociation kinetics, temperature and time dependence of their formation, range of rna polymerase/dna weight/weight ratios that give rise to the stable binding events. the amount and the distibution of the sites that form stable complexes with p. lividus rna polymerase ii were determined by the analysis of the dissociation of the complexes formed by the enzyme on dna fragments of various lengths. p. lividus appears to form 4.5 × stable (t1/2≥ min) complexes/haploid genome. a part of these complexes has a distribution corresponding to values between and base pairs; the rest of the complexes is more widely spaced (up to a measured interval of base pairs).	biology
background: the western diet increases risk of metabolic disease. objective: we determined whether lowering the ratio of saturated fatty acids to monounsaturated fatty acids in the western diet would affect physical activity and energy expenditure. design: with the use of a balanced design, cohorts of and young adults were enrolled in separate randomized, double-masked, crossover trials that compared a 3-wk high–palmitic acid diet (hpa; similar to the western diet fat composition) to a low–palmitic acid and high–oleic acid diet (hoa; similar to the mediterranean diet fat composition). all foods were provided by the investigators, and the palmitic acid (pa):oleic acid (oa) ratio was manipulated by adding different oil blends to the same foods. in both cohorts, we assessed physical activity (monitored continuously by using accelerometry) and resting energy expenditure (ree). to gain insight into a possible mood disturbance that might explain changes in physical activity, the profile of mood states (poms) was administered in cohort 2. results: physical activity was higher during the hoa than during the hpa in of subjects in cohort (p = 0.008) (mean: 12% higher; p = 0.003) and in of subjects in the second, confirmatory cohort (p = 0.005) (mean: 15% higher; p = 0.003). when the hoa was compared with the hpa, ree measured during the fed state was 3% higher for cohort (p < 0.01), and ree was 4.5% higher in the fasted state for cohort (p = 0.04). poms testing showed that the anger-hostility score was significantly higher during the hpa (p = 0.007). conclusions: the replacement of dietary pa with oa was associated with increased physical activity and ree and less anger. besides presumed effects on mitochondrial function (increased ree), the dietary pa:oa ratio appears to affect behavior. the second cohort was derived from a study that was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as r01dk082803.	biology

during pregnancy, disorders in uterine spiral artery remodeling (usar) cause preeclampsia and other diseases. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-hete) on the biological behavior of human villous trophoblasts (hvts) and human uterine vascular smooth muscle cells (huvsmcs), and explore the role of 20-hete in usar. 20-hete and its inhibitor het0016 were used to study migration, invasion and apoptosis in the hvt and hvt-huvsmc models. 20-hete inhibited the migration and invasion of hvts, and inhibited apoptosis in huvsmcs and huvsmcs co-cultured with hvts. 20-hete had thus obvious effects on the biological behavior of hvts and huvsmcs. these effects may cause usar disorders and vascular dysfunction, leading to preeclampsia.	biology
alimentary and endogenous proteins are mixed in the small intestinal lumen with the microbiota. although experimental evidences suggest that the intestinal microbiota is able to incorporate and degrade some of the available amino acids, it appears that the microbiota is also able to synthesize amino acids raising the view that amino acid exchange between the microbiota and host can proceed in both directions. although the net result of such exchanges remains to be determined, it is likely that a significant part of the amino acids recovered from the alimentary proteins are used by the microbiota. in the large intestine, where the density of bacteria is much higher than in the small intestine and the transit time much longer, the residual undigested luminal proteins and peptides can be degraded in amino acids by the microbiota. these amino acids cannot be absorbed to a significant extent by the colonic epithelium, but are precursors for the synthesis of numerous metabolic end products in reactions made by the microbiota. among these products, some like short-chain fatty acids and organic acids are energy substrates for the colonic mucosa and several peripheral tissues while others like sulfide and ammonia can affect the energy metabolism of colonic epithelial cells. more work is needed to clarify the overall effects of the intestinal microbiota on nitrogenous compound metabolism and consequences on gut and more generally host health.	biology
random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) was used for hop varietal identification, primarily to distinguish tsingtaodahua, a fine chinese variety. eleven typical varieties, including four aroma hops, five bitter hops, tsingtaodahua and cluster, were successfully identified on the basis of polymorphic rapd bands amplified by five random primers. upgma analysis of rapd data showed genetic relationship among analyzed varieties consistent with traditional hop classification. subsequently, one specific rapd fragment was converted to a sequence tagged site (sts) marker which can detect as little as a 5% admixture of the variety kirin in tsingtaodahua. the rapd and sts markers can be successfully used for tsingtaodahua identification and quality control.	biology
summary data on the dynamics of craniofacial growth, obtained by simple non-invasive measurements, are scarce in comparison with those collected by cephalometric methods. the aim of this study was to measure a number of craniofacial parameters, and to evaluate their changes during transition from the deciduous to the permanent dentition. a sample of subjects (32 boys and girls) were followed longitudinally by annual examination from an initial mean age of 4.7 years to a final mean age of 11.8 years. conventional anthropometric instruments were employed to measure six craniofacial variables: g-op, eu-eu, zy-zy, go-go, n-gn and n-pr. the data were analysed using basic summary statistics and a longitudinal regression model. a difference between males and females was found for all variables during the study period. during the transition from deciduous to mixed dentition (4.7-7.5 years), the cranial breadth and length (eu-eu and g-op) decreased followed by an increase during the mixed dentition. all other parameters showed a continuous increase, which was highest for the variables defining facial height.	biology

the recently described gene, rab32, is a ras proto-oncogene family member that encodes an a-kinase-anchoring protein. rab32 has been found to be frequently hypermethylated in microsatellite instability-high (msi-h) colon cancers. we sought to determine the prevalence of rab32 hypermethylation in gastric and endometrial adenocarcinomas, the other major tumor types in which msi-h is common. moreover, we delineated the association of rab32 hypermethylation with microsatellite instability (msi) and hmlh1 hypermethylation. msi status and hypermethylation of the rab32 and hmlh1 genes were studied in paired primary normal and tumor tissues from patients with gastric cancer. an additional endometrial cancer patients were studied for rab32 methylation and msi status. thirteen (27%) of gastric cancers demonstrated evidence of rab32 hypermethylation. msi status was determined in of the tumors, with (100%) of msi-h tumors, (33%) of msi-low (msi-l) tumors and (11%) of microsatellite-stable (mss) tumors found to harbor rab32 hypermethylation. rab32 methylation was significantly associated with intestinal type histology and concomitant hmlh1 hypermethylation in gastric cancer. in contrast, rab32 methylation occurred in only of endometrial cancers, including msi-h, msi-l and mss tumors. hypermethylation of hmlh1 was noted in (20%) of endometrial tumors. we conclude that although rab32 methylation is rare in endometrial cancers, it is strongly associated with hmlh1 hypermethylation and msi in gastric adenocarcinomas. given its similar involvement in colon cancer, rab32 inactivation may represent a component of the oncogenic pathway of microsatellite-unstable gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas.	biology
a protocol has been developed for in vitro clonal propagation leading to conservation of bacopa monnieri (l) wettst, a medicinal plant of high commercial potential with legendary reputation as a memory vitalizer. single node explants when cultured on murashige and skoog’s medium supplemented with ba (0.2 mg l-1), showed active shoot proliferation (22.2 shoots/ explant in weeks) without callus formation. rooting was achieved on the same medium. the generated shoots could also be conserved for months with high survival rate (up to 100%). the regenerants upon transfer to soil showed no morphological variation as compared with the donor plants. the medium optimized in the present study was applied for culture establishment and conservation of a total of brahmi accessions procured from different regions.	biology
clinical and experimental biomedical studies have shown type diabetes mellitus (t2dm) to be a risk factor for the development of alzheimer's disease (ad). this study demonstrates the effect of metformin, a therapeutic biguanide administered for t2dm therapy, on β-amyloid precursor protein (app) metabolism in in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models. furthermore, the protective role of insulin against metformin is also demonstrated. in lan5 neuroblastoma cells, metformin increases app and presenilin levels, proteins involved in ad. overexpression of app and presenilin (pres 1) increases app cleavage and intracellular accumulation of β-amyloid peptide (aβ), which, in turn, promotes aggregation of aβ. in the experimental conditions utilized the drug causes oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, decrease of hexokinase-ii levels and cytochrome c release, all of which lead to cell death. several changes in oxidative stress-related genes following metformin treatment were detected by pcr arrays specific for the oxidative stress pathway. these effects of metformin were found to be antagonized by the addition of insulin, which reduced aβ levels, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. similarly, antioxidant molecules, such as ferulic acid and curcumin, are able to revert metformin's effect. comparable results were obtained using peripheral blood mononuclear cells. finally, the involvement of nf-κb transcription factor in regulating app and pres expression was investigated. upon metformin treatment, nf-κb is activated and translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it induces increased app and pres transcription. the use of bay11-7085 inhibitor suppressed the effect of metformin on app and pres expression.	biology
primary leaves of oats (avena sativa l.) have been used to study the integration of secondary phenolic metabolism into organ differentiation and development. in particular, the tissue-specific distribution of products and enzymes involved in their biosynthesis has been investigated. c-glucosylflavones along with minor amounts of hydroxycinnamic-acid esters constitute the soluble phenolic compounds in these leaves. in addition, considerable amounts of insoluble products such as lignin and wall-bound ferulic-acid esters are formed. the tissue-specific activities of seven enzymes were determined in different stages of leaf growth. the rate-limiting enzyme of flavonoid biosynthesis in this system, chalcone synthase, together with chalcone isomerase (ec 5.5.1.6) and the terminal enzymes of the vitexin and isovitexin branches of the pathway (a flavonoid o-methyltransferase and an isovitexin arabinosyltransferase) are located in the leaf mesophyll. since the flavonoids accumulate predominantly (up to 70%) in both epidermal layers, an intercellular transport of products is postulated. in contrast to the flavonoid enzymes, l-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (ec 4.3.1.5), 4-coumarate: coa ligase (ec 6.2.1.12), and s-adenosyl-l-methionine: caffeate 3-o-methyltransferase (ec 2.1.1.-), all involved in general phenylpropanoid metabolism, showed highest activities in the basal leaf region as well as in the epidermis and the vascular bundles. we suggest that these latter enzymes participate mainly in the biosynthesis of non-flavonoid phenolic products, such as lignin in the xylem tissue and wall-bound hydroxycinnamic acid-esters in epidermal, phloem, and sclerenchyma tissues.	biology

to exit the blood, leukocytes must either squeeze past or go directly through the endothelial cells that line the vessels. according to christopher carman, timothy springer (harvard medical school, boston, ma), and colleagues, to take the latter transcellular route, leukocytes first palpate the endothelial cell with exploratory protrusions called podosomes. the leukocytes then use one, or sometimes several, of these podosomes to push right on through. figure a leukocyte (pink) palpates an endothelial cell (gray) with podosomes until it finds a route through. the team found that approximately one-third of leukocytes made their way across an in vitro vascular endothelial monolayer by transcellular migration. carman suggests that, in vivo, at least in some settings, the proportion might be higher. transcellular migration might even be favored over the paracellular route, as the latter could potentially weaken cell–cell junctions. to investigate the mechanism of transcellular migration, the team used a combination of live fluorescence and electron microscopy. shortly after leukocytes were added to the monolayer, invaginations in the endothelial membranes appeared coincident with the formation of podosomes by the leukocytes. the leukocytes used these podosomes to prod and poke the endothelial cell until they find a route of least resistance. organelles other than the nucleus were then pushed out of the way as one large, invasive podosome created a transcellular pore. leukocytes that were deficient for an actin regulatory protein called wasp formed podosomes poorly and were thus inefficient in forming transcellular pores. paracellular migration continued as normal, however. endothelial cells survived despite this continuous puncturing by migrating leukoctyes. indeed, multiple leukocytes were able to pass through a single endothelial cell—carman has spotted up to eight at a time—lending further evidence that this could be the predominant route for transendothelial leukocyte migration in vivo. reference: carman, c., et al. 2007. immunity. 26:784–797.

embryo implantation is a complicated process involving interactions between the blastocyst and the luminal epithelium of the receptive uterus. mucin (muc1) is an integral membrane glycoprotein expressed apically by secretory epithelial cells and the glandular epithelium in different organs, including the uterus. it is believed that loss of muc1 on the surface of uterine epithelial cells is necessary for embryo implantation. the endogenous non-protein coding micrornas (mirnas) of 21-24 nucleotides are found in diverse organisms. it has been shown that mirnas participate in a range of cellular processes by regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. in the present study, the regulatory role of mirna-199a on the expression of muc1 in mouse uterus during implantation was investigated for its effect on embryo implantation. western blotting and immunohistochemistry results showed high muc1 expression on day 0.5 and low expression by day 4.5 of pregnancy. in contrast with muc1 expression, increased mirna-199a expression was evident at day 4.5 of pregnancy, as measured by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. in addition, we demonstrated direct binding of mirna-199a to the 3'-untranslated region of muc1. transfection of mirna-199a into mouse uterine epithelial cells isolated from day 0.5 of pregnancy also downregulated expression of muc1. therefore, the present study provides evidence that muc1 is a direct target of mirna-199a and suggests that development of novel strategies to facilitate a successful pregnancy and repair implantation failure humans may include mirna.	biology
ixodes persulcatus is the primary vector for human tick-borne diseases in japan. a cdna library was constructed from whole body homogenates of fed nymphs of i. persulcatus. from this library, one cdna encoding defensin-like antimicrobial peptide was identified. the amino-acid sequence showed high similarity to those of the defensins of other ticks and arthropods. i. persulcatus defensin mrna transcripts were detected at all life cycle stages of fed ticks and found to be predominantly expressed in the midguts of adult female ticks, but not in the salivary glands, a finding corroborated by western blotting analysis. to investigate the function of i. persulcatus defensin, we examined its antibacterial activity by evaluation of growth of several bacterial strains in the presence of the synthetic peptide. the defensin from i. persulcatus markedly inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium renale, but not gram-negative bacteria except escherichia coli o157. in conclusion, these results suggest that i. persulcatus defensin may be playing a significant role in the defence against microbes from bloodmeals.	biology
spinal muscular atrophy (sma) is a neurodegenerative disease resulting from decreased levels of survival motor neuron (smn1) protein. reduced smn1 levels are linked to pathology at neuromuscular junctions (nmjs), which includes decreased vesicle density and organization, decreased quantal release, increased endplate potential duration, and neurofilament (nf) accumulations. this work presents a first study towards defining molecular alterations that may lead to the development of nmj pathology in sma. fast, anterograde transport of synaptic vesicle (sv2-c) and synaptotagmin (syt1) proteins was reduced days prior to the observed decrease in synaptic vesicle density. moreover, reduced accumulation of sv2-c or syt1 was not due to reduced protein expression or reduced kinesin activity. dynein levels were reduced at times that are consistent with nf accumulations at nmjs. furthermore, nf distribution, from cell body to sciatic nerve, appeared normal in sma∆7 mice. taken together, these results suggest that reduced axonal transport may provide a mechanistic explanation for reduced synaptic vesicle density and concomitant synaptic transmission defects, while providing evidence that suggests nf accumulations result from local nmj alterations to nfs.	biology
explants of fetal rat liver maintained in organ culture lost about 40% of their mass in hr of incubation as a result of decrease in blood cells and hepatocytes. proteins from the cytosol and particulate elements of the tissue were found in the culture medium. about 60% of this protein was degraded to peptides during culture. the transfer of malate and lactate dehydrogenases from tissue to medium paralleled that of proteins. glutamate dehydrogenase was lost from the mitochondria and in part leaked through the cell membrane into the medium. net loss of activity of the three enzymes occurred, probably as a consequence of proteolytic degradation. of enzymes in liver tissue, the specific activities of eight—soluble malate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, phosphopyruvate carboxylase, hexosediphosphatase, glucose-6-phosphatase, tyrosine, aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase—were unchanged or increased. glycogen synthetase, aspartate aminotransferase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase decreased. although changes in membrane permeability may have had some influence on the results reported, the predominant effect was due to loss of protein from tissue as a result of discharge of total contents of some of the cells into the medium. the residual explanted tissue retained its structural integrity. it is concluded that fetal rat liver in organ culture provides a suitable model system for controlled studies with this organ in vitro.	biology
tan spot of wheat, caused by the ascomycete pyrenophora tritici-repentis, is an economically important disease in all the major wheat growing areas worldwide. even though the pathogen was known to occur on grasses and episodically on wheat for more than eight decades, large-scale epidemics of tan spot were first recorded in the early 1970s. the increased incidence was associated with stubble retention, a practice implemented in the context of soil conservation. the present review highlights some of the recent developments that have occurred in studies of the wheat - p. tritici-repentis interaction and discusses the implications for our understanding of host-parasite relations in general. races of p. tritici-repentis produce at least three host-specific toxins, effective on particular host lines or cultivars. single dominant and independently inherited genes control host reaction to these toxins, with one gene for each toxin. eight races of the pathogen have now been identified from collections made in sev...	biology

two feeding trials were conducted to evaluate the soybean meal as a substitute for the fish meal in diet (experiment i), and experimental practical diet and commercial diet (experiment ii) for growth of far eastern catfish. in the experiment i, three replicate groups of juveniles (average weight 7.2 g) were fed one of diets containing and 20% soybean meals for days. survival and final mean weight were not significantly affected by dietary soybean meal levels. no significant differences were observed in feed efficiency, protein efficiency ratio and protein retention of fish fed between 0% (control diet) and 20% soybean meal diets. however, fish fed 10% soybean meal diet showed the lower feed efficiency, protein efficiency ratio and protein retention, and higher daily feed intake compared with fish fed control diet and 20% soybean meal diet. the contents of moisture, crude protein, crude lipid and ash in the whole body were not significantly affected by dietary soybean meal levels. in the experiment ii, three replicate groups of juveniles (average weight 7.3 g) were fed either the formulated diet or commercial diet for days. survival and final mean weight were not significantly different among treatment. significantly higher feed efficiency, protein efficiency ratio and protein retention, and lower daily feed intake were observed in fish fed experimental practical diet compared with fish fed commercial diet (p	biology
the inactivation of the von hippel-lindau (vhl) tumor suppressor gene not only results in tumor initiation, but also mediates tumor metastasis. however, the mechanisms by which vhl inactivation leads to metastasis have not yet been well defined. in this study, the silencing of vhl in 3ao and skov3 ovarian cancer cells was found to promote cell motility and to increase the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)2, mmp9, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (hif-1α) and microrna (mir)-210. the suppression of hif-1α with its inhibitor 3-(5'-hydroxymethyl-2'-furyl)-1-benzylindazole (yc-1) in vhl-silenced 3ao cells antagonized the pro-migratory activity induced by the vhl deficiency and reversed the upregulation of mmp2, mmp9, hif-1α and mir-210; however, it had no obvious effect on the vhl protein level. the introduction of mir-210 inhibitor into vhl-silenced 3ao cells resulted in similar changes as those induced by yc-1. furthermore, vacuole membrane protein (vmp1) was found to be diminished by vhl silencing in a hif-1α/mir-210-dependent manner. taken together, our data demonstrate that the loss of vhl stimulates ovarian cancer cell migration by stabilizing hif-1α, upregulating mir-210 and decreasing vmp1 expression. these results indicate that the aberrant signaling of the vhl/hif-1α/mir-210/vmp1 pathway may be involved in ovarian cancer aggressiveness.	biology
twenty-nine patients with chronic hepatitis c and asymptomatic hepatitis c virus antibody–positive subjects who clinically recovered from hepatitis c virus infection were studied for their peripheral blood lymphomononuclear cell proliferative response to hepatitis c virus structural and nonstructural antigens (core, envelope, nonstructural and nonstructural 5) expressed in yeast as superoxide dismutase fusion proteins, in an initial attempt to define some of the features of the virus-specific immune response. hepatitis c virus core was the most immunogenic antigen for human leukocyte antigen class ii–restricted t cells in both groups of patients studied, and the proliferative response to it was the most vigorous and the most frequently expressed in comparison with the other antigens tested. the specificity of the results was supported by the lack of response to hepatitis c virus antigens by healthy uninfected controls and confirmed by recognition of recombinant core proteins of different origin (yeast and baculovirus) by polyclonal t-cell lines produced by t-cell stimulation with yeast-derived core. each of the antigens tested was able to induce significant although variable levels of proliferative response, indicating that all can be immunogenic at the t-cell level. significant proliferative responses to core, nonstructural and nonstructural antigens were more frequently detected in subjects who were able to eradicate infection than in patients with chronic hepatitis c, although the difference was statistically not significant. no difference was observed between the two groups of patients with respect to the response to the putative envelope antigens.

during development of the retina in mammals and birds, most retinal ganglion cells (rgc) that are produced are eliminated later in development by cell death. in lower vertebrates, however, such massive cell death has not been observed; total ganglion cell number increases linearly during most of development. using 3h-thymidine or 5-bromodeoxyuridine labeling of retinal cell nuclei, we have been able to identify postmitotic rgc populations in xenopus central retina at different developmental stages and follow their fate during development to postmetamorphic stages. rgc populations that become postmitotic between embryonic stages and during the initial stages of retinal growth, lose 40-77% of their cells during metamorphosis (approximately 4,000-5,000 cells). twenty percent of the rgc present at stage which later disappear, represent the same population of dying rgc that were present at stage 49. this suggests that the ganglion cells that became postmitotic between stage and 53/54 show no apparent decline in numbers during metamorphosis. since thyroxine is known to stimulate an increase in rgc number as well as the extent of fiber projection on the tectum, we suggest that this reduction in rgc numbers is not due to thyroxine-induced neuronal cell death. after stage however, binocular vision develops in xenopus (keating, '74) and ipsilateral fibers begin to grow into thalamic visual neuropils (hoskins and grobstein, '85). we suggest, therefore, that as in mammals, in which rgc elimination correlates with binocular segregation of contralateral and ipsilateral retinal axons in visual centers, a similar process may occur in the frog among those rgc projecting to thalamic visual neuropils.	biology
a dwarf plant isolated from anther culture of a normal genotype of birdsfoot trefoil (lotus corniculatus l. cv. leo) has been isolated, characterized, and maintained as an in vitro shoot-tip culture. the dwarf condition is the result of a much shorter internode length when compared with a normal genotype in shoot tip culture. dwarf shoots which are typically rosette respond to increased ga3 levels by increased internode growth. normal genotypes are inhibited and eventually die as a result of increased levels of ga3 in the culture medium. this dwarf has the normal tetraploid chromosome number of and although stable in shoot tip cultures since has not survived outside of in vitro shoot tip cultures.	biology
we have devised techniques with which to detect specific proteins as well as mrnas in individual cells of the nervous system. we have localized proteins to specific cells in sections of the neonatal rat cerebellum by immunofluorescence and in the same cells have localized mrnas by in situ hybridization. the specific protein identified was glial fibrillary acidic protein. the [3h] complementary dna probes used in the in situ hybridization experiments were synthesized using as templates polyadenylated mrnas isolated from neonatal rat cerebellum. such dual detection can be used to assess the cellular sites of synthesis of the many proteins that have been localized in brain and other tissues by immunohistochemistry.	biology
infectious diseases are responsible for the extinction of a number of species. in conventional epidemic models, the transition from endemic population persistence to extirpation takes place gradually. however, if host demographics exhibits a strong allee effect (ae) (population decline at low densities), extinction can occur abruptly in a catastrophic population crash. this might explain why species suddenly disappear even when they used to persist at high endemic population levels. mathematically, the tipping point towards population collapse is associated with a saddle-node bifurcation. the underlying mechanism is the simultaneous population size depression and the increase of the extinction threshold due to parasite pathogenicity and allee effect. since highly pathogenic parasites cause their own extinction but not that of their host, there can be another saddle-node bifurcation with the re-emergence of two endemic equilibria. the implications for control interventions are discussed, suggesting that ef...	biology
cytotoxic t lymphocytes (ctl) recognize protein antigens which have been processed by the target cell and then presented in association with the relevant class i molecule of the major histocompatibility complex (mhc). short synthetic peptides, which are able to associate directly with target cells, may substitute for these processed fragments in stimulating antigen-specific ctl responses. using this approach, a dominant hla-a2-restricted epitope has previously been mapped to residues 58-68 of influenza a virus matrix protein. here we report hla-a2-restricted ctl which are also able to recognize this short synthetic peptide in association with hla-aw69, but which fail to recognize hla-aw69 expressing cells infected with influenza a virus. furthermore, individuals possessing hla-aw69 who respond to influenza a virus, do not respond to m58-68. these results imply that the low response to this epitope on infection of hla-aw69 individuals with influenza a is due to failure of the naturally processed product of matrix protein to associate with aw69.	biology
using roche/454 technology, we sequenced the chloroplast genomes of triticeae species, including bread wheat, barley and rye, as well as the diploid progenitors and relatives of bread wheat triticum urartu, aegilops speltoides and ae. tauschii. two wild tetraploid taxa, ae. cylindrica and ae. geniculata, were also included. additionally, we incorporated wild einkorn wheat triticum boeoticum and its domesticated form t. monococcum and two hordeum spontaneum (wild barley) genotypes. chloroplast genomes were used for overall sequence comparison, phylogenetic analysis and dating of divergence times. we estimate that barley diverged from rye and wheat approximately 8–9 million years ago (mya). the genome donors of hexaploid wheat diverged between 2.1–2.9 mya, while rye diverged from triticum aestivum approximately 3–4 mya, more recently than previously estimated. interestingly, the a genome taxa t. boeoticum and t. urartu were estimated to have diverged approximately 570,000 years ago. as these two have a reproductive barrier, the divergence time estimate also provides an upper limit for the time required for the formation of a species boundary between the two. furthermore, we conclusively show that the chloroplast genome of hexaploid wheat was contributed by the b genome donor and that this unknown species diverged from ae. speltoides about 980,000 years ago. additionally, sequence alignments identified a translocation of a chloroplast segment to the nuclear genome which is specific to the rye/wheat lineage. we propose the presented phylogeny and divergence time estimates as a reference framework for future studies on triticeae.	biology
trim5alpha is a host restriction factor that mediates a ca-specific block to retroviral infection. trim5alpha binding to the viral protein is only detectable when ca is in the multimeric protein lattice of the retroviral core. this suggested that trim5alpha might function as a pattern recognition receptor (prr) analogous to a tlr. additionally, trim5 is located within a cluster of interferon-stimulated genes. we therefore sought evidence for functional links between trim5alpha and innate immune factors. trim5alpha was induced by type i interferons and prr agonists in thp-1 cells and monocyte-derived dendritic cells and macrophages. induction kinetics, knockdown of irf3, stat1, stat2, or ifnar, and ifnar-blocking antibodies, demonstrated that trim5alpha induction is isgf3-dependent. in parallel, we found that establishment of an antiviral state with interferon or prr agonists prevented hiv-1 transduction of thp1 cells or monocyte-derived dendritic cells and macrophages. trim5alpha knockdown in thp1 cells largely rescued hiv-1 from the antiviral state, independent of envelope pseudotype. this effect of trim5 knockdown was independent of ca and even observed with non-retroviruses. we have now established that trim5 contributes to the antiviral state via effects on specific factors that act upstream of nfκb and ap-1.	biology
neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis is the most common class of neurodegenerative disease in children. after decades of study, the biochemical basis for this group of diseases continues to elude scientists. one obstacle has been the difficulty in establishing specific criteria for diagnosis. this paper reviews case material from patients referred to the shriver center for study from january, to december, 1986. the late-infantile type was the most commonly encountered (35%) with a mean age-of-onset of 3.1 +/- 0.5 yr. the juvenile type was slightly less frequent (32%) with a mean age-of-onset of 7.8 +/- yr. the infantile type ranked third (23%); age-of-onset +/- months) and the adult form of the disease was the least common (10%; age-of-onset +/- yr). consistent clinical findings were a progressive decline in mental faculties and seizures, predominantly of the myoclonic type. neuroradiological changes of cerebral and cerebellar cortical atrophy were common when studies were obtained more than a year after clinical onset. ataxia was a frequent manifestation in the late-infantile and juvenile types whereas dystonia was unique to the latter. there was a diversity of ultrastructural findings in skin biopsies between and within types. the absence of findings in a few familial cases necessitated sampling a second tissue such as muscle, particularly when the history was suggestive and urine dolichols were high. elevated urine dolichol levels was a nonspecific but helpful finding.	biology
the mitotic checkpoint plays an important role in preventing chromosome segregation errors and the production of aneuploid progeny. in this issue, zhang et al. examine mice and cells lacking the deubiquitinating enzyme usp44. surprisingly, they find that usp44 prevents chromosome segregation errors through a function independent of its previously identified role in the mitotic checkpoint. usp44-null animals develop aneuploidy and experience increased rates of tumorigenesis, implicating usp44 as novel tumor suppressor.	biology
epithelia are key barriers to infections. in periodontal disease, the gingival sulcular epithelium becomes ulcerated. in this report, we test the hypothesis that short-chain carboxylic acids (scca) inhibit keratinocyte proliferation, increase necrosis and apoptosis, and may thus promote ulceration. scca produced by bacteria are present at millimolar concentrations in the periodontal pockets of subjects with periodontal disease. scca concentrations are higher in subjects with severe disease than in those with mild disease, and are not detectable in healthy subjects. cell proliferation is critical for maintenance of epithelial barrier function. all scca tested, when neutralized, decreased epithelial cell proliferation (as measured by 3h-thymidine incorporation) in a dose-dependent manner. we found that epithelial cell viability decreased with increasing scca concentrations, accounting at least partly for the decreased 3h-thymidine incorporation. for all conditions we tested, scca-induced apoptosis preceded and exceeded necrosis. while the molecular mechanism(s) for these effects remain to be determined, the results indicate that scca derived from caries- or periodontal disease-associated bacteria could alter gingival barrier function.	biology
tunisia has experienced a variety of human migrations that have modeled the myriad cul- tural groups inhabiting the area. both arabic and ber- ber-speaking populations live in tunisia. berbers are commonly considered as in situ descendants of peoples who settled roughly in palaeolithic times, and posterior demographic events such as the arrival of the neolithic, the arab migrations, and the expulsion of the ''moors'' from spain, had a strong cultural influence. nonetheless, the genetic structure and the population relationships of the ethnic groups living in tunisia have been poorly assessed. in order to gain insight into the paternal genetic landscape and population structure, more than y-chromosome single nucleotide polymorphisms and short tandem repeats were analyzed in five tunisian ethnic groups (three berber-speaking isolates, one anda- lusian, and one cosmopolitan arab). the most common lineage was the north african haplogroup e-m81 (71%), being fixed in two berber samples (chenini-douiret and jradou), suggesting isolation and genetic drift. differen- tial levels of paternal gene flow from the near east were detected in the tunisian samples (j-m267 lineage over 30%); however, no major sub-saharan african or euro- pean influence was found. this result contrasts with the high amount of sub-saharan and eurasian maternal lin- eages previously described in tunisia. overall, our results reveal a certain genetic inter-population diver- sity, especially among berber groups, and sexual asym- metry, paternal lineages being mostly of autochthonous origin. in addition, andalusians, who are supposed to be migrants from southern spain, do not exhibit any sub- stantial contribution of european lineages, suggesting a north african origin for this ethnic group. am j phys anthropol 146:271-280, 2011. v v c wiley-liss, inc.	biology

the packaging of chromosomal dna by nucleosomes not only condenses and organizes the genome but also blocks access of dna-binding proteins to regulatory dna elements. however, this process also allows nucleosomes and other chromatin components to actively participate in the regulation of transcription, dna replication, dna repair, and other chromosomal processes. to enable dynamic regulation of nucleosomes, cells have evolved a set of specialized chromatin remodeling complexes (termed remodelers) that use the energy of atp hydrolysis to slide, destabilize, eject, or edit/restructure nucleosomes. here, we address many aspects of remodeler function, including their composition, specialization, mechanisms, and regulation. we also address their roles in embryonic stem cells, differentiation, development, cancer, and human disease syndromes.	biology
in two cases of polyepiphyseal dysplasia with a probable autosomal recessive transmission, ultrastructural abnormalities were found in the chondrocytes of the tibial epiphyseal growth plate. the largest part of the chondrocytes is occupied by many large vacuoles. they are bounded by a single membrane and have an electron-lucent background in which electron-opaque granules and delicate spiral filaments are visible. the ultrastructural abnormalities suggest a storage disorder probably limited to the chondrocytes.	biology
immunologic, biochemical, and morphologic characteristics of the mononuclear cell from the leukemia of f344 rats were determined. the cells were morphologically similar to large granular lymphocytes (lgl). surface marker analysis revealed fc gamma receptors, no fc gamma receptor or complement receptor activity, and an inability to spontaneously rosette guinea pig erythrocytes. leukemia cells also had a surface immunoglobulin that hemagglutinated normal rat erythrocytes. the surface immunoglobulin and fc gamma receptors dissociated from the cell after hours of in vitro incubation, but fc gamma receptor activity was reexpressed after hours of in vitro incubation. cells were capable of adherence to glass surfaces but had a low capacity for phagocytosis of latex beads. cytochemical analysis revealed a consistent, strongly positive reaction for esterase that was sensitive to naf. the cytochemical profile of the leukemia cell was similar to that described for lgl.	biology
we have demonstrated that anticancer drugs at cytostatic concentrations enhance the expression and function of epidermal growth factor (egf-r) and transferrin (trf-r) receptors on human tumor cells. we hypothesized that these effects could represent a protective response of tumor cells to sublethal antiproliferative stimuli which could lead to enhanced growth potential. hours exposure of human melanoma gll-19 cells to 1,000 nm ara-c induced growth inhibition and increased the number of egf-r, trf-r and nerve growth factor receptor (ngf-r) on cell surface. enhanced expression of beta integrins cd49a, cd49c and cd49e, av integrin cd51, beta integrin cd61, cd58/lfa3 and collagen iv and laminin was also detected in ara-c-treated gll-19 cells. these changes at the tumor cell surface were paralleled by increased in vitro adhesion, invasive potential and clonogenic growth in soft agar and in vivo tumor formation. a more aggressive tumor cell phenotype is induced in human melanoma cells after transient exposure to cytostatic concentrations of ara-c.	biology
the spider abundance in weeded and non-weeded plots in a lime orchard was compared. the experiment was done at the tropical research and education center (trec), homestead, florida. samplings were taken from april to july 1998. the results of the preliminary test showed that the abundance of the web-building spiders was not significantly different between the weeded and the non-weeded plots for all the sampling periods. however, for hunting spiders the abundance was significantly higher in the non-weeded plots than in the weeded plots. this results suggests the importance of weeds as refuge area for the hunting spiders.	biology
this study was conducted to assess three stakeholders’ level of involvement in coral reef conservation activities in perhentian island. the stakeholders participated in this study encompassed of the besut district department of marine parks (terengganu), local entrepreneurs and tourists. a total of respondents were selected to answer the survey questionnaire. the chi-square test results found a difference in the level of involvement among stakeholders with the besut district department of marine parks (terengganu) and local entrepreneurs has the highest level of involvement, while there was low involvement with the tourists. the majority (40%) of the besut district department of marine parks (terengganu) staff were involved in the coral reef conservation at the rate of one to three times a year. similarly, for the entrepreneurs, the majority (44%) of them also involved in the coral reef conservation at a rate one to three times a year while the majority of tourists (72%) never involved in the conservation of coral reefs. in terms of types of coral reefs conservation activities, most stakeholders have experiences in beach cleaning activities and education about coral reef conservation (21% for both). overall, this study conclude with suggestion to improve the level of stakeholders’ involvement in coral reefs conservation in order to achieve the aims of sustainable tourism in the future.	biology

reactive oxygen intermediates are metabolites normally produced on aerobic metabolisms and has been linked to processes like oxidative stress and aging. despite this negative paradigm about roi, another set of evidence in mammals suggest that these reactive intermediates can act as important second messengers in a variety of cellular signaling processes such as those involved on the immune response. primary cultures of hemocytes from the chilean scallop argopecten purpuratus were developed to study a possible link between the production of reactive oxygen intermediates and the expression of an antimicrobial peptide, big defensin, under a context of immune response. a modified leibovitz l-15 medium supplemented with 50% of sterile plasma from scallop was essential for hemocyte adhesion an survival. the ability of these primary cultures to develop an immune response was confirmed by phagocytic activity and roi production essays. the antimicrobial peptide big defensin was up-regulated in response to the β-glucan zymosan and this up regulation could be diminished near to constitutive levels by the treatment of cultured hemocytes with the antioxidant trolox for hours before the immune induction. this results constitutes the first evidence on invertebrates that supports a rol of intracellular oxygen intermediates as promoters of the expression of an antimicrobial effector during an immune response.	biology
nutrition plays a major influence on reproductive efficiency directly, through supply of nutrients to the physiological functions, and indirectly in the synthesis of hormones and the amount of receptors on cells and their metabolic interactions. the monitoring of body condition score is still the most widely used tool to nutritional monitoring. however, works done in brazil have shown that the scale score still lacks evaluation and adapted to hair sheep raised in brazil. besides this influence, nutrition plays an acute or immediate effect which is also explored in the production system, as the flushing o nutrients, which consists of a supplementation at levels above the requirement of the animals aiming stimulate ovulation rate, size of ovarian follicles and embryo survival. the effect of flushing is already well documented, as well as its limitations. advances in this issue are the flushing of nutrients with recognized role in reproduction such as fatty acid which must be more studied. finally, one of the most studied fields currently is the fetal programming or the impact of nutrition during pregnancy on productive and reproductive aspects of the new generation. the increasing knowledge in this area has demonstrated that the success in animal production begins before birth and even in the early embryonic development impacting the entire productive life of the animal.	biology
responses to daily injections of bovine growth hormone (gh, 0.15 mg kg-1 liveweight), beginning on day of lactation, were measured in lactating ewes. milk yields of gh-treated ewes increased soon after commencement of injections and continued to increase for some days before reaching plateau levels. by comparison, yields of ewes injected with excipient (controls) decreased over the experiment. there was a tendency for contents of milk fat to be higher and milk protein to be lower for gh-treated than for control ewes during the first 15-20 days after injections were started. at the beginning and over the first 15-20 days of the experiment feed intakes of both groups of ewes were similar, but thereafter intakes of gh-treated ewes gradually increased to reach plateau levels some 200-300 g day-1 higher than for control ewes by about day 35. liveweights of both groups of ewes decreased during the first weeks of treatment then increased, with gh-treated ewes losing, then gaining, more weight than control ewes. the efficiency of food utilization for milk production was higher for gh-treated than control ewes throughout the experiment but digestibility of food organic matter was not different during the eighth week of the experiment. at the end of the experiment, body composition, assessed by dilution of tritiated water, was similar for both groups of ewes. differences in milk production were not sustained after withdrawal of gh injections. measurements of tissue uptake of key metabolites were made on days and of gh treatment. on day gh lowered uptake of glucose and non-esterified fatty acids by leg muscle tissue and increased mammary uptake of non-esterified fatty acids. by day there were no apparent differences of tissue uptake of key metabolites. the results indicate that there is a biphasic response to exogenous gh in the lactating ruminant. it appears that initially gh affects nutrient partition thereby increasing supplies to the mammary gland of key nutrients for milk synthesis. in the longer term, gh increases feed intake, which provides sufficient nutrients to sustain increased milk production and also liveweight gain.	biology

nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) affects one-third of the population and two-thirds of patients with obesity or type diabetes (t2dm). its more aggressive form is known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (nash) and is characterized by hepatocyte necrosis, inflammation and often fibrosis. the presence of fibrosis indicates a more aggressive course and may lead to cirrhosis. premature mortality in nash is related to both hepatic (cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma) and extra-hepatic complications, largely cardiovascular disease (cvd). many therapeutic agents have been tested, but still none approved specifically for nash. treatment of nafld includes aggressive management of diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors, although the role of controlling hyperglycemia per se in patients with t2dm and nash remains unknown. agents tested with some success in non-diabetic patients with nash include pioglitazone, liraglutide, vitamin e and to a lesser degree, pentoxiphylline. in patients with t2dm and nash only pioglitazone has shown to significantly improve liver histology, with only a handful of patients with diabetes having been studied with other modalities. this review focuses on available agents for nash to assist clinicians in the management of these complex patients. many novel compounds are being studied and will likely make combination therapy for nash a reality in the future.	biology

objective : whole plant and various parts of thevetia peruviana were reported to possess several pharmacological properties, due to the vast array of secondary metabolites. the present investigation was carried out to illustrate the cytotoxic and antimicrobial properties of seed kernel extracts on two tumor cell lines and various human skin-pathogenic microbes. methods : cold methanol extracts and successive soxhlet fractions of seed samples were incubated with tumor cell lines in vitro for h at o c, and cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion method. antimicrobial efficacy was detected by well diffusion protocol against five bacterial strains and two fungal strains at varying concentrations ranging from 10-0.025 mg/6 mm wells, using different fractions from three color variants. results : of the evaluated samples, cold extract of seed kernels has potent cytotoxicity, with ic values 0.458 and 0.522 mg/ml on both cell lines than soxhleted ethyl acetate (ea) fractions (0.851 and 0.712 mg/ml). antimicrobial efficacy against pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.67±1.15 mm), nocardia asteroids (15.00±0.00) and candida albicans (14.33±0.58) strains were effective for ea (10 mg/well) than chloroform (ch) and methanol (mt) fractions, but lower concentrations of ch fractions showed higher sensitivity against c. albicans . conclusion : cytotoxic properties of seed kernels could be utilized against various human cancer cell lines to reduce tumor growth, and the bactericidal and fungicidal efficacy would be helpful in eradicating some common human skin infectious pathogenic microbes.	biology
a cardioacceleratory peptide, cap2b, identified originally in the lepidopteran manduca sexta, stimulates fluid secretion by malpighian tubules of the dipteran drosophila melanogaster. high-performance liquid chromatography analyses of adult d. melanogaster reveal the presence of a cap2b-like peptide, that coelutes with m. sexta cap2b and synthetic cap2b and that has cap2b-like effects on the m. sexta heart. cap2b accelerates fluid secretion in tubules stimulated by adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (camp) but has no effect on tubules stimulated by guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cgmp), implying that it acts through the latter pathway. by contrast, the action of leucokinin is additive to both camp and cgmp but not to thapsigargin, suggesting that leucokinin acts by the elevation of intracellular calcium. cap2b stimulation elevates tubule cgmp levels but not those of camp. by contrast, leucokinin has no effect on levels of either cyclic nucleotide. both cap2b and cgmp increase transepithelial potential difference, suggesting that stimulation of vacuolar-adenosinetriphosphatase action underlies the corresponding increases in fluid secretion. overall, the results show that a drosophila cap2b-related peptide acts to stimulate fluid secretion by malpighian tubules through the cgmp-signaling pathway.	biology

the existence of a hepato-biliary pump for iga has been studied in sheep by measuring appearance of radioactivity in bile after simultaneous i.v. injection of igg2 and homologous dimeric iga each labelled with either 125i or 131i. these experiments confirm that in sheep, as in rodents, iga is the predominant immunoglobulin in bile and is selectively transported into bile from serum relative to igg2. in addition, there is evidence for local production of iga in bile presumably by plasma cells within the liver and biliary tree.	biology
cholestyramine feeding of rats increased the rate of palmitate and glycerol incorporation into triacylglycerols of isolated hepatocytes. concomitantly an increase of fatty-acid binding by hepatic cytosolic proteins was observed, which could be attributed to an elevation of the content of the fatty-acid-binding protein (mr 12000). the involvement of this protein in cholesterol, bile-acid and triacylglycerol metabolism is discussed.	biology
manipulating stand composition is an important management tool that foresters can use to affect the nature of forests and ecosystem processes. in mixed stands, interspecific interactions among trees can cause changes in tree performances. nevertheless, these interactions are context dependent (cf. stress-gradient hypothesis, sgh). we thus investigated how intraspecific functional changes in leaf trait (19 traits) of european beech (fagus sylvatica) were influenced by stand composition. we compared pure beech stands with four mixed stands containing from one to three additional tree species along a gradient of edaphic stress (gradient of soil water-holding capacity and rooting depth). first, we demonstrated that stand composition induced strong intraspecific leaf trait variation in beech for ldmc, lma, phenolic compounds, leaf ph and magnesium concentration, suggesting higher nutrient acquisition by more diverse stands. nevertheless, these results were modulated by edaphic stress. mixed stands only conferred an advantage in relatively stressed sites (luvisol and leptosol). besides, the addition of oak to beech stands had unexpected negative effects in sites with less severe stress (cambisol) as indicated by the null or positive logrr of lma, ldmc and phenolics. this study found that stand composition is an important though often-overlooked driver of intraspecific variability in leaf quality, and potentially reflects changes in beech tree physiology and productivity. our results also suggest that positive interactions prevail in sites with stressful conditions. such validation of the sgh is rare in natural or managed mature forests. lastly, we strongly recommend that forest managers consider stand composition and abiotic factors when implementing forest growth models to improve their yield predictions.	biology
the effect of feeding diets containing various ca:p ratios (4:1, 1:1, 1:2) to rachitic and nonrachitic chicks has been studied. the ca:p ratios used had no significant effect on ca absorption in chicks receiving vitamin d but were of importance in the ca absorption of rachitic chicks. vitamin d was found to increase ca absorption in chick duodenum but had no effect on glucose absorption. increased peristalsis was obtained when vitamin d or the least rachitogenic ca:p ratio (1:1) was fed. a possible increase in intestinal mucosa respiration was also observed when vitamin d or the 1:1 ca:p ratio was fed.	biology
"the influence of closing the eyes (by means of a special device) on the neuronal activity in the visual and motor cortical areas was analysed in a trained rabbit during behavioural act of seizing the food. it was found that activation of the neurones of both cortical areas in the course of the act appears both with closed and open eyes at all its stages, i.e. for appearance of neurons activity no contact is required with the ""visual part"" of the surroundings. this fact is discussed from the viewpoint of ""purposive"" neuronal activity. both the composition of the involved elements of both cortical areas and the shape of their activity were changing during performance of behaviour with closed eyes, the changes being more pronounced in the visual area. a hypothesis is advanced that the differences in the changeability of the neuronal activation in the studied structures are determined by their heterochronous maturation in the process of behaviour formation in ontogenesis."	biology
metal pollution issues are afforded the highest priority in developing countries. only one previous study has addressed metals in african bird eggs. we determined the concentration of metals and metalloids in bird eggs from four sites in the vaal river catchment (vrc) of south africa to provide data on the current situation. we analysed pools of heron, ibis, darter, egret, and cormorant eggs for metals and metalloids using icp-ms. we found high concentrations of gold (au), uranium (u), thallium (tl), and platinum (pt) in grey heron eggs from baberspan. great white egrets from bloemhof dam had high concentrations of mercury (hg). multivariate analyses revealed strong associations between au and u, and between palladium (pd) and pt. the toxic reference value (trv) for hg was exceeded in seven pools. selenium exceeded its trv in one pool; in the same pool, copper (cu) reached its trv. compared with other studies, vrc bird eggs had high concentrations of contaminants. based on these high concentrations, human health might be at risk as grey herons and humans share similar food and are therefore exposed to the same contaminants.	biology
"glucocorticoids have strong regulatory actions on the immune system and act as potent therapeutic compounds for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. we previously reported that the long noncoding rna growth arrest-specific (gas5), which accumulates inside the cells in response to cellular starvation/growth arrest, functions as a potent repressor of the glucocorticoid receptor (gr) through its rna ""glucocorticoid response element (gre)"". to evaluate potential roles of gas5 in immune-related disorders, we examined gas5 rna levels in various autoimmune, inflammatory, and infectious diseases using the microarray data available in the gene expression omnibus. we found that gas5 levels were altered in whole blood or leukocytes of the patients with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, and sarcoidosis. gas5 levels were also altered in infectious diseases, such as by the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 and influenza virus, and bacterial sepsis. in our experimental analysis using mice, gas5 levels were kept at high basal levels and did not respond to fasting in immune organs, such as spleen and thymus, while its levels in metabolic organs, including liver, fat, and skeletal muscles, were low at baseline and were highly elevated upon this treatment, possibly through suppression of the mtor pathway. these results suggest that gas5 plays a role in the regulation of immune functions and pathogenesis/pathophysiology of autoimmune, inflammatory, and infectious diseases in part through modulation of the gr transcriptional activity via its decoy rna ""gre"". changes in the gas5 levels may also influence disease response to immunosuppressive glucocorticoid therapy."	biology
the hypothesis is discussed that the innervation of the early mandibular and maxillary processes influences the initiation and patterning of tooth germs. silver staining of embryonic mouse tissue supports the notion that the innervation is present before tooth buds appear. data from other experimental studies is discussed in support of this hypothesis. the importance of the early events of tooth morphogenesis in initiating and patterning the dentition is discussed in the context of tooth morphogenesis as a whole. the processes involved in odontogenesis are categorized as phase i: initiating events; phase ii: histogenetic events; and phase iii: cytodifferentiative events. the complications of the interrelationship of these three seemingly discrete segments of tooth development are discussed in the context of inductive tissue interaction.	biology

the selection of alternative splice sites is an important component of cell-specific gene regulation in eukaryotic cells. use of splice sites can be positively and negatively regulated, and often physiologically appropriate splice site choice is achieved by a balance of the two. rna elements controlling splice site choice are found in both exons and introns, and these determine management by the cellular splicing machinery. however, the molecular basis of how the splicing machinery responds to these signals in different cells is somewhat of a paradox. thus far the identified proteins which bind to tissue/cell-specific regulatory elements in mammals are expressed in many different tissues, and not just in the regulating tissue. potential tissue-specific splicing regulators have been identified by nonbiochemical means. however, alternative splicing choices are likely to be affected by subtle differences in the splicing machinery in different cells. in this review i suggest that one important factor is the ratio of proteins in different nuclear compartments, which might be established in a cell type specific fashion.	biology
this paper reports on the effect of various micropropagation factors of gmelina arborea roxb. through multiple shoot induction. factors like the source and age of explants, plant growth regulators (pgrs), media composition, and carbon source affected multiple shooting in the present study. among all the explants used, only shoot tips derived from one, two, and three week old seedlings could form multiple shoots. besides, the formation of multiple shoots depended on the concentration and combination of pgrs. among all the pgrs, bap (6-benzylaminopurine) alone gave the highest regeneration efficiency. similarly, iba (indole-3-butyric acid) was the most efficient pgr in inducing root formation in the microshoots. media composition and carbon source also affected the regeneration efficiency. ms (murashige and skoog medium) proved to be the best media for regeneration followed by b5, sh (schenk and hilderbrandt medium) and wpm (woody plant medium) in that order. similarly, among sugars, only sucrose and glucose supported induction of microshoots. based on this study we recommend the use of glucose in place of sucrose in ms medium for maximum regeneration efficiency.	biology

4-[4''-(2'',2'',6'',6''-tetramethyl-1''-piperidinyloxy)amino]-4'- demethylepipodophyllotoxin (gp-7) 10-40 mg.kg-1 ip daily for d reduced the specific antibody formation of splenocytes, serum agglutinin titer, and hemolysin hc50 in mice immunized with srbc. gp-7 inhibited the footpad delayed hypersensitivity reaction and decreased the weights of spleen and thymus, but did not affect the phagocytic function of the peritoneal macrophages. in vitro the proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes activated by con a was markedly inhibited by gp-7 in a concentration- dependent manner. at concentrations of 0.05-5 mg.l-1, the inhibition rates were 24-96%. these results suggested that gp-7 was an immunosuppressive agent.	biology
to study interlaminar phenotypic variations in the pyramidal neurons of parietal isocortex in bat (cynopterus sphinx), golgi and nissl methods have been employed. the parietal isocortex is relatively thin in the bat as compared to prototheria with layer iii, v and vi accounting for more than two-thirds of total cortical thickness. thick cell free layer i and thinnest accentuated layer ii are quite in connotation with other chiropterids. poor demarcation of layer iii/iv in the present study is also in connotation with primitive eutherian mammal (i.e. prototherian) and other chiropterids. most of the pyramidal cells in the different layers of the parietal isocortex are of typical type as seen in other eutherians but differ significantly in terms of soma shape and size, extent of dendritic arbor, diameter of dendrites and spine density. percentage of pyramidal neurons, diameter of apical dendrite and spine density on apical dendrite appear to follow an increasing trend from primitive to advanced mammals; but extent of dendrites are probably governed by the specific life patterns of these mammals. it is thus concluded that ‘typical’ pyramidal neurons in parietal isocortex are similar in therians but different from those in prototherians. it is possible that these cells might have arisen among early eutherians after divergence from prototherian stock.	biology
the cop9 signalosome has been implicated in pluripotency maintenance of human embryonic stem cells. yet, the mechanism for the cop9 signalosome to regulate pluripotency remains elusive. through knocking down individual cop9 subunits, we demonstrate that cops2, but not the whole cop9 signalosome, is essential for pluripotency maintenance in mouse embryonic stem cells. down-regulation of cops2 leads to reduced expression of pluripotency genes, slower proliferation rate, g2/m cell cycle arrest, and compromised embryoid differentiation of embryonic stem cells. cops2 also facilitates somatic cell reprogramming. we further show that cops2 binds to nanog protein and prevent the degradation of nanog by proteasome. moreover, cops2 functions as transcriptional corepressor to facilitate pluripotency maintenance. altogether, our data reveal the essential role and novel mechanisms of cops2 in pluripotency maintenance.	biology
limousine, hereford and simmental bulls were assigned at the start of finishing at months of age to three analogous groups (6 animals per group). during a 70-day treatment period, animals were fed with uniform rations containing maize silage and meadow hay silage ad libitum with a supplement of hay (l kg/day) and concentrate (1% body weight/day). the following parametres were determined: live body weight, chemical composition of feeds, fatty acid profile of feeds, dressing percentage, chemical composition and fatty acid content of thoracis muscle. limousine and simmental bulls were characterized by a higher fattening and slaughter value. they also showed a higher level of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) of thoracis muscle and a lower content of fatty acids c 14:0 and c 16:0. compared to simmentals, hereford and limousine bulls showed a higher level of monounsaturated fatty acids (muf a) and a narrower and close to normal n-6/n-3 pufa ratio.	biology

the molecular mechanisms of neural plasticity, learning and memory are still poorly understood. the nematode caenorhabditis elegans is capable of responding to a variety of environmental changes through its nervous system, consisting of only neurons. c. elegans is an ideal model organism to elucidate neural plasticity, learning and memory at molecular, cellular and neuronal network levels. thermotaxis behavior is particularly amenable to dissect learning and memory at all these levels. after cultivation at a certain temperature with food, c. elegans migrates to the cultivation temperature on a temperature gradient. by contrast, cultivation in food-deprived condition induces cultivation temperature avoidance behavior on a temperature gradient. we have been conducting forward as well as reverse genetic approaches to identify molecules, neurons and neuronal networks that are responsible for aspects of learning and memory in thermotaxis behavior.	biology

the changes of kernel nutritive components and seed vigor in f1 seeds of sh2 sweet corn during seed development stage were investigated and the relationships between them were analyzed by time series regression (tsr) analysis. the results show that total soluble sugar and reducing sugar contents gradually declined, while starch and soluble protein contents increased throughout the seed development stages. germination percentage, energy of germination, germination index and vigor index gradually increased along with seed development and reached the highest levels at d after pollination (dap). the tsr showed that, during to dap, total soluble sugar content was independent of the vigor parameters determined in present experiment, while the reducing sugar content had a significant effect on seed vigor. tsr equations between seed reducing sugar and seed vigor were also developed. there were negative correlations between the seed reducing sugar content and the germination percentage, energy of germination, germination index and vigor index, respectively. it is suggested that the seed germination, energy of germination, germination index and vigor index could be predicted by the content of reducing sugar in sweet corn seeds during seed development stages.	biology

tsc2 is a gene on chromosome 16p13.3 associated with the autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder, tuberous sclerosis complex (tsc). by using a partial nucleotide sequence from the cloned tsc2 and polymerase chain reaction methodology, we constructed a digoxigenin-labeled complementary dna probe to examine tsc2 gene expression in autopsy- or biopsy-derived human tissues by in situ hybridization. tsc2 messenger rna was widely expressed in various cell types throughout the body, including epithelia, lymphocytes, and cells with endocrine functions, e.g., adrenal cortex and anterior pituitary. it was prominently and selectively (within the central nervous system) expressed in pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex and other motor neurons, e.g., in spinal cord and brainstem nuclei. visceral tsc2 expression was comparable in autopsy tissues from patients with and without tsc; tsc2 messenger rna expression was most prominent in cells with a rapid mitotic rate and turnover, e.g., epithelia and lymphocytes, with central nervous system pyramidal cells and other neurons being an obvious exception, and/or in cells with important secretory/transport functions. this widespread expression of the tsc2 gene supports the view that it encodes a protein vital to cell growth and metabolism or one that functions as a tumor/growth suppressor.	biology
despite the recent gains in malaria control, falciparum malaria still causes an estimated million cases globally and kills 0.58 million patients each year [1]. once severe disease develops, the case-fatality rate is around 8% in children and 15% in adults despite optimal antimalarial treatment with artesunate [2]. a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is critical for developing adjunctive treatments to lower morality. lactic acidosis is a common complication of severe malaria, which has a strong predictive value for death in both pediatric and adult patients [3, 4]. lactate accounts for approximately one fourth of the strong acids [5] present in severe malaria. the high lactate to pyruvate ratios in severe malaria indicate that anaerobic glycolysis most likely results from microcirculatory hypoperfusion [6]. impairment of tissue microcirculatory flow is caused by the sequestration of cytoadherent red blood cells (rbcs) containing mature forms of the malaria parasite [7–9]. rosetting, autoagglutination, and endothelial cell dysfunction may further compromise microcirculatory flow [10, 11]. reduced uninfected rbc deformability (rcd) is thought to be an additional contributing factor [10, 12]. other causes include circulatory shock and severe anemia, compromising oxygen delivery. the relative contributions of these factors to lactic acidosis have not been well established. in this prospective study of adults hospitalized with falciparum malaria, we measured the plasma p. falciparum histidine-rich protein (hrp2) concentration as a proxy measure for the total and sequestered parasite biomass [13], rcd, and other established contributors to lactic acidosis and assessed their relative associations with plasma lactate concentrations.	biology

a b s t r a c t in this study the effect of acidification of the drinking water of broiler chickens on both direct and indirect transmission of campylobacter was evaluated. in the direct transmission experiment both susceptible and inoculated animals were housed together. in the indi- rect transmission experiment the susceptible animals were spatially separated from the inoculated animals and no direct animal to animal contact was possible. the transmission parameterwas estimated for the groups supplied with acidified drinking water and for the control groups. the results showed that acidification of the drinking water had no effect on direct transmission (ˇ = 3.7 day−1 for both control and treatment). indirect transmis- sion however was influenced by acidification of the drinking water. a significant decrease in transmission was observed (p < 0.05), with control vs. treatment point estimates being ˇ = 0.075 day −1 vs. ˇ = 0.011 day −1 .	biology

discovery of cryptic species using molecular tools has become common in many animal groups but it is rarely accompanied by morphological revision, creating ongoing problems in taxonomy and conservation. in copepods, cryptic species have been discovered in most groups where fast-evolving molecular markers were employed. in this study at yeelirrie in western australia we investigate a subterranean species complex belonging to the harpacticoid genus schizopera sars, using both the barcoding mitochondrial coi gene and landmark-based two-dimensional geometric morphometrics. integumental organs (sensilla and pores) are used as landmarks for the first time in any crustacean group. complete congruence between dna-based species delimitation and relative position of integumental organs in two independent morphological structures suggests the existence of three distinct evolutionary units. we describe two of them as new species, employing a condensed taxonomic format appropriate for cryptic species. we argue that many supposedly cryptic species might not be cryptic if researchers focus on analyzing morphological structures with multivariate tools that explicitly take into account geometry of the phenotype. a perceived supremacy of molecular methods in detecting cryptic species is in our view a consequence of disparity of investment and unexploited recent advancements in morphometrics among taxonomists. our study shows that morphometric data alone could be used to find diagnostic morphological traits and gives hope to anyone studying small animals with a hard integument or shell, especially opening the door to assessing fossil diversity and rich museum collections. we expect that simultaneous use of molecular tools with geometry-oriented morphometrics may yield faster formal description of species. decrypted species in this study are a good example for urgency of formal descriptions, as they display short-range endemism in small groundwater calcrete aquifers in a paleochannel, where their conservation may be threatened by proposed mining.	biology
the construction of eight large weirs in the nakdong river, korea, caused a decrease in the water flow velocity and several physical changes to the water environment. here, changes in phyto- and zooplankton communities and water quality in the areas near the eight weirs were investigated from to and relationships between phytoplankton abundances and environmental factors were analyzed. special emphasis was given to the succession patterns in algal abundance based on temperature fluctuations. at the eight weirs, dominant species were found. the most abundant phytoplankton species was stephanodiscus sp. (39.4% of dominant frequency). cyanobacteria of the genus microcystis dominated during the summer, with an dominant frequency of 8.5% and cell abundance ratio of 36.6%. significant correlations were observed between temperature and abundance of eight of the main dominant species; seven species showed positive correlations with temperature. stephanodiscus sp., however, showed a negative correlation with temperature (r=-0.26, p.0.01). in addition, this species showed a significant negative correlation with the dominant algal species-aulacoseira granulata and aphanizomenon flos-aquae, with the zooplankton copepoda and with cladocera. on the contrary, seven other dominant species of algae showed significant positive correlations with zooplankton. thus, we showed that the seasonal succession of plankton communities in the nakdong river was related to the water temperature changes.	biology

the expression of the proto-oncogene c-myc has been strongly implicated in the regulation of apoptosis. since we have previously shown apoptosis to occur in hl-60 leukemic cells exposed to the prodrug mafosfamide (asta z 7557), the present study was undertaken to examine the levels of c-myc mrna transcripts in such cells. mafosfamide, which is a cyclophosphamide derivative that rapidly generates 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide after aqueous dissolution, was employed in doses ranging from 0.1 to micrograms/ml. no changes in c-myc mrna levels were evident after hour of exposure to mafosfamide. after and hours of mafosfamide-exposure, however, there was a dose- and time-dependent decrease in c-myc transcripts. c-myc mrna expression was reduced to a greater extent than was either beta-actin of gapdh expression. morphological, biochemical and ultrastructural evidence of apoptosis accompanied the mafosfamide-induced c-myc mrna down-regulation at hours. we conclude that, in the context of mafosfamide-treated hl-60 cells, upregulation of c-myc mrna transcription was not fundamental for the activation of the apoptotic cascade.	biology
epithelia abolished the cell’s ability to respond to stressors adequately (fig g). to test whether the assumption that ormdl overexpression impairs epithelial repair thus promoting the development toward an asthmatic phenotype, we performed a simple wound repair assay using cultured human lung epithelial cells (beas-2b). this scratch assay was performed with control beas-2b cells (transfected with an empty vector) and those transfected with an ormdl3 overexpression vector (fig h). the wound repair assay demonstrated that ormdl3-overexpressing beas-2b cellsshow adelay inwound closure, implying that their repair capacity is reduced. in conclusion, we found that increased epithelial ormdl expression, which mimics the situation found in carriers of the risk allele, changes cellular response characteristics in a way that promote asthma development. ormdl overexpression changes 1) terminal airway structures, 2) increases the susceptibility to stressors such as cs and hypoxia, 3) abolishes the airway epithelial’s ability to react adequately to stressors, and 4) reduces the repair capacities of the epithelium substantially. we hypothesize that these ormdl overexpression-induced changes are of central importance for the observed phenotypes that collectively lead to an increased susceptibility to acquire asthma.	biology
reasons for the decline of the mariana crow (corvus kubaryi) on the western pacific island of rota are currently unknown, but a need to protect nesting habitat has been suggested. we examined actual nest sites and random sites from to to investigate habitat characteristics specific to crow nest sites. both nests and random plots were predominantly in limestone forest habitat. discriminant function analyses indicate actual nest sites were differentiated from random sites based on a higher percentage of canopy cover and mean dbh of papaya (carica papaya) and woody vines, as well as a higher stem count of species associated with limestone forests. this resulted in correct classification of a potential site as nesting versus random in 92% of the cases. actual nests were >300 m from buildings, while random sites averaged (± se) 226.7 ± 71.6 m from a building. actual nest sites were about twice as far from a road as random nest sites. twenty-eight of the active nests fledged young. nests in native forests were associated with higher reproductive success than nests in more disturbed areas. these findings suggest that damage to habitat from anthropogenic or natural causes may be limiting nesting success. received february 2010. accepted november 2010.	biology
early weaning of piglets can lead to an increase in belly-nosing and other oral-nasal behavior (nosing, chewing, or sucking other piglets), but the causative factors involved in these behavior patterns are largely unknown. because these behavior patterns resemble massaging the udder and sucking, they may be associated with feeding. the objectives of this study were to determine any effect of diet quality or the presence of milk in the diet on belly-nosing behavior of piglets weaned at to d. during the first wk after weaning, piglets were fed diets differing in quality and inclusion of milk products. six replicates of eight piglets per replicate, blocked by initial body weight, (n = 192) were offered one of four dietary treatments: hqm: high quality, high in milk products; hq: high quality, no milk products; pq: poor quality, no milk products; hq+mr: high quality, no milk products (as hq) sprayed with milk replacer five times daily. thereafter, the piglets were fed a standard nursery diet. feed intake was measured daily for wk and again at the end of wk 2. behavior was recorded every min during two 4-h periods on d to and after weaning. dietary treatment influenced adfi and adg during wk 1. average daily feed intake (p 0.10) and adg (p > 0.10) were the same across all treatments. overall, adfi was not influenced by the inclusion of milk products in the diet or the addition of milk replacer (p > 0.10); however, adg was. piglets on hqm had higher adg than those on hq during wk (p 0.10). although the dietary treatments did affect adfi and adg, there were no effects on any behavior pattern recorded, including time spent at the feeder (p > 0.10). lower weight-for-age piglets performed more oral-nasal behavior, in total, than higher weight-for-age piglets (p < 0.03). neither feeding a poor-quality diet nor the presence of milk in the diet had an effect on belly-nosing or other oral-nasal behavior patterns during the first wk after weaning. belly-nosing does not seem to be associated with feeding.	biology
fluconazole is a triazole antifungal compound suitable for the treatment of fungal infections, including those caused by candida albicans. fluconazole, as all azole antifungals, is a potent inhibitor of ergosterol biosynthesis. the aims of this study are to evaluate the susceptibility of c. albicans strains isolated from clinical specimens against fluconazole, and to assess the decrease in ergosterol produced on these strains when they are incubated in vitro with this antifungal compound. sixty six yeast strains were isolated and identified from vaginal specimens of women of a tocogynecology surgery (9.3%), c. albicans being the most frequent species (n = ca. 79%). an agar dilution technique was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of fluconazole for the c. albicans strains. the mics rank was between and micrograms/ml (mean = 6.6 micrograms/ml). ergosterol content from ten c. albicans strains (mic for fluconazole = micrograms/ml) was assessed using the method proposed by breivik and owades, with three concentrations of fluconazole (2.5, and micrograms/ml) and four contact times (1, and h), in comparison to no treated strains (control). the mean content of ergosterol was lower in the treated strains than in the control ones, and became statistically significant after h of incubation.	biology

gaining insights into the biology of human stem cells and into the early embryonic development opens new avenues for generating tissue-specific cells from embryonic stem cells or other pluripotent stem cell sources. with respect to metabolic liver diseases, recent advances in understanding endodermal specification during gastrulation of the post-implantation embryo and in understanding the formation of the hepato-biliary system have strong impact on improved protocols to generate stem cell-derived hepatic cells. the landmark studies from shinya yamanaka and co-workers opened a new era in stem cell biology, by providing a technology that allows the generation of pluripotent stem cells from patients’ cells and, thus, allowing the generation of disease-specific stem cells. taken together these two major advances in the field of stem cell biology, new approaches for studying metabolic liver diseases in correlation to individual patient’s symptoms are available, which provide a breakthrough in new drug target research or individual gene-therapeutic therapies.	biology
a single point mutation in the human lipoprotein lipase gene which results in an a → g nucleotide change at codon (nucleotide 1127) of the lipoprotein lipase gene, and a substitution of serine for the normal asparagine in the lipoprotein lipase gene product is seen with increased frequency in patients with coronary artery disease, and is associated with an increased susceptibility to coronary artery disease, including in particular premature atherosclerosis. this is expressed as a diminished catalytic activity of lipoprotein lipase, lower hdl-cholesterol levels and higher triglyceride levels. thus, susceptibility of a human individual to premature atherosclerosis can be evaluated by: (a) obtaining a sample of dna from the individual; and (b) evaluating the sample of dna for the presence of nucleotides encoding a serin residue as amino acid of the lipoprotein lipase gene product. patients found to be suffering from or likely to suffer from premature atherosclerosis and other forms of coronary artery disease as a result of a lipoprotein lipase deficiency can be treated using gene therapy.	biology
thrombin is a multifunctional serine protease which plays a central role in blood coagulation. it has also been implicated in fibroproliferative disorders where it induces migration and proliferation of mesenchymal cells. stimulation of these processes occurs via activation of par-1 (protease activated receptor -1). in this study we have used antisense oligonucleotides (ccccattgtcccgggctctg) to the par-1 thrombin receptor in an attempt to down-regulate par-1 expression and inhibit thrombin-induced fibroblast proliferation. antisense oligonucleotides were delivered to the cells alone or complexed with lipofectin and an integrin-targetting peptide (peptide [k]gacrretawacg), based on an αβ-specific peptide. proliferation of human foetal lung fibroblasts (hfl-1) was assessed spectrophotometrically based on the uptake and elution of methylene blue. thrombin (25nm) stimulated fibroblast proliferation by 54%±8% compared with cells grown in media alone. antisense oligonucleotides at concentrations of up to 10μm alone failed to inhibit thrombin induced proliferation. however, oligonucleotides at 1μm complexed with lipofectin and an αβ integrin-targetting peptide inhibited thrombin-induced fibroblast proliferation by 76%±12% (p<0.01). transfection with the oligonucleotide complex did not affect proliferation of fibroblasts grown in media alone. inhibition of thrombin receptor expression may therefore provide a method of inhibiting thrombin mediated cellular effects without affecting haemostasis. these data suggest that antisense oligonucleotides to par-1 may be useful as antifibrotic therapies.	biology

the vertical movements of a teleostean fish may be restricted by the presence of the swimbladder, which will increase or decrease in volume when the fish moves up or down in the water. it is shown that the restriction that the swimbladder imposes to vertical movements involving a reduction in pressure will depend on physical factors such as (1) the resistance that the bladder and body wall offer to the expansion of the bladder gas. (2) the percentage volume of the swimbladder and the density change of the fish when it is subjected to a reduction in pressure. (3) the pressure reduction that leads to the rupture of the bladder wall. a distinction is made between rapid and slow movements. in the former the compensatory ability of the fish must be considered and in the latter the speed with which the fish can accommodate itself to pressure changes. an equation is derived from which the minimum speed at which a physoclist can migrate from deep to shallow water can be calculated. to solve the equation two factors must be determined experimentally. various experiments are described which were made on the perch, perca fluviatilis , the wrasse, crenilabrus melops , the rockling, onos mustela and the dragonet, callionymus lyra . the results showed that there was a relation between the relative size of the swimbladder and the change in the density of a fish when it is subjected to a reduction in pressure; that the bladder and body wall of the perch offer little resistance to the expansion of the bladder gas; and that the danger of the bladder wall rupturing might restrict the extent of rapid movements made by the perch. experiments on the restriction that the swimbladder imposes to the rapid and slow vertical movements of the perch will be described in a following paper.	biology

photosynthesis is the process that keeps algae alive. in our lab, we set out to answer whether or not changing white light for red light would affect the growth of the algae. we tested four samples of algae in red light and one sample of white light over a three week period and measured the cell density in weekly increments. we found some evidence that algae use multiple wavelengths of light in photosynthesis, and that optimal growth does not occur under red light alone. the cell density of the samples under red light from week one to week two was minimal, showing only a small increase in cell density. week two to week three showed next to no growth.	biology

the present immunohistochemical studies used polyclonal antibodies specific to epidermal growth factor (egf), transforming growth factor-alpha (tgf-alpha), and monoclonal antibodies to the extracellular binding domain of egf receptor to elucidate their presence and cellular distribution in surgically induced endometriosis in the rat. uterine segments were implanted in the mesenteric region adjacent to a blood vessel for a period of 4-6 weeks. during operative reexploration, the implanted tissues were intact, morphologically similar to the controls, and consisted of a cyst containing clear fluid and associated adhesion formation. all the uterine cell types immunostained with antibody to egf. the highest immunostaining intensity was associated with inflammatory cells infiltrated among endometrial stromal cells, followed by luminal and glandular epithelial and stromal cells. the cysts consisted of an inner simple columnar epithelium, surrounded by several layers of smooth muscle and connective tissue. the cyst epithelial layer immunostained weakly, while the supporting wall stained moderately. the inflammatory cells found within the cyst cavity immunostained very intensely, comparable to those in the endometrium. the patterns of immunostaining for tgf-alpha and egf receptor were similar to that observed for egf. myometrial smooth-muscle cells and endothelial and smooth-muscle cells of arterioles were also immunostained for egf, tgf-alpha, and egf receptor, but with lower intensity than that of the endometrium. these observations suggest that, like normal uterine tissue, endometrial implants produce egf and tgf-alpha locally and contain receptors for egf. these results imply a possible paracrine or autocrine role for growth factors in the establishment and/or maintenance of endometriotic tissue.	biology

severe deformities of the hind limb skeleton such as shortening, abnormal curvatures, terminal expansions, curled toes and joint dislocations were produced in frog tadpoles by the osteolathyrogenic principle. gross-anatomical features of the deformed skeleton and of the respective nervous trunks were studied in specimens cleared according to williams' technique. the findings support the previously suggested osteo-neural concept: experimental skeletal deformities represent adaptations of the bone growth at the organ level to the inadequate extensive growth of the nervous trunks. the neural growth appears to be more severely affected by the teratogen than the bone growth proper.	biology
two experiments were conducted to evaluate alpha-tocopherol accumulation in muscle of lambs finished on pasture or concentrates. the objective for exp. was to compare accumulation of alpha-tocopherol in the longissimus muscle of pasture-fed lambs to that of lambs fed three concentrations (15, and iu/kg of dm) of supplemental vitamin e (all rac alpha-tocopheryl acetate) in all-concentrate diets. the objective in exp. was to investigate the effect of duration of supplemental vitamin e feeding on alpha-tocopherol content and color change during display case storage of lamb muscle. treatments evaluated in exp. were: iu of supplemental vitamin e/kg dm fed to finish; iu/kg followed by iu/kg of dm during the last d; and iu/kg dm until d prior to finish, then iu/kg dm. in exp. alpha-tocopherol concentration of rotational grazed alfalfa and perennial ryegrass averaged and mg/kg of dm. vitamin e treatments for lambs fed concentrate diets did not affect adg (p > 0.15), but adg was greater (p 0.50) alpha-tocopherol concentrations, and those concentrations were similar to values obtained when the concentrate diet supplemented with iu of vitamin e/kg was fed. in exp. no differences (p > 0.10) in adg were observed. concentrations of longissimus alpha-tocopherol were highest when iu supplemental vitamin e was fed for d prior to slaughter. during a 6-d display period, semimembranosus steaks from lambs fed iu of supplemental vitamin e/kg for either or d had higher a* and b* color readings than steaks from lambs fed iu/kg of supplemental vitamin e. increased consumption of vitamin e either via pasture or supplementation results in higher alpha-tocopherol concentrations in meat.	biology

the effect of phagocytosis on lectin bind- ing to plasma membranes of polymorphonuclear leuko- cytes was examined. the specific activities of binding sites of concanavalin a and ricinus communis agglutinin (defined as gg of lectin bound per pg of membrane protein) were measured on isolated membranes; they decreased in parallel with phagocytosis. our data suggest that this removal occurs by concentration of binding sites into internalized membrane. colchicine and vinblastine, which did not inhibit phagocytosis, prevented the selective removal of lectin-binding sites from the surface. it was also shown that at lectins induce their own internaliza- tion. this property was used to define operationally three classes of lectin receptors, one of which is most extensively removed from plasma membrane during phagocytosis. based on other morphological studies in which it is shown that before phagocytosis the surface distribution of con- canavalin-binding sites is random, it is inferred that phagocytosis alters surface topography by inducing the selective movement of binding sites into membrane under- going internalization and that colchicine-sensitive pro- teins are essential for this imposed topographical re- organization.	biology

using crispr/cas9, diverse genomic elements may be studied in their endogenous context. pairs of single guide rnas (sgrnas) are used to delete regulatory elements and small rna genes, while longer rnas can be silenced through promoter deletion. we here present crispeta, a bioinformatic pipeline for flexible and scalable paired sgrna design based on an empirical scoring model. multiple sgrna pairs are returned for each target. any number of targets can be analyzed in parallel, making crispeta equally appropriate for studies of individual elements, or complex library screens. fast run-times are achieved using a precomputed off-target database. sgrna pair designs are output in a convenient format for visualisation and oligonucleotide ordering. we present a series of pre-designed, high-coverage library designs for entire classes of non-coding elements in human, mouse, zebrafish, drosophila and c. elegans. using an improved version of the decko deletion vector, together with a quantitative deletion assay, we test crispeta designs by deleting an enhancer and exonic fragment of the malat1 oncogene. these achieve efficiencies of ≥50%, resulting in production of mutant rna. crispeta will be useful for researchers seeking to harness crispr for targeted genomic deletion, in a variety of model organisms, from single-target to high-throughput scales.	biology
despite the many efforts made by the scientific community in the development of vaccine candidates against dengue virus (denv), no vaccine has been licensed up to date. although the immunopathogenesis associated to the disease is a key factor to take into account by vaccine developers, the lack of animal models that reproduce the clinical signs of the disease has hampered the vaccine progress. non-human primates support viral replication, but they are very expensive and do not show signs of disease. immunocompromised mice develop viremia and some signs of the disease; however, they are not valuable for vaccine testing. nowadays, immunocompetent mice are the most used model to evaluate the immunogenicity of vaccine candidates. these animals are resistant to denv infection; therefore, the intracranial inoculation with neuroadapted virus, which provokes viral encephalitis, represents an alternative to evaluate the protective capacity of vaccine candidates. previous results have demonstrated the crucial role of cellular immune response in the protection induced by the virus and vaccine candidates in this mouse encephalitis model. however, in the present work we are proposing that the magnitude of the cell-mediated immunity and the inflammatory response generated by the vaccine can modulate the survival rate after viral challenge. we observed that the intracranial challenge of naive mice with denv-2 induces the recruitment of immune cells that contribute to the reduction of viral load, but does not increase the survival rate. on the contrary, animals treated with cyclophosphamide, an immunosuppressive drug that affects proliferating lymphocytes, had a higher viral load but a better survival rate than untreated animals. these results suggest that the immune system is playing an immunopathogenic role in this model and the survival rate may not be a suitable endpoint in the evaluation of vaccine candidates based on antigens that induce a strong cellular immune response.	biology

we have recently demonstrated that the human immunodeficiency virus type (hiv-1) envelope glycoprotein gp160 enhances the in vitro differentiation of hematopoietic myeloid progenitor cells derived from cord blood by inducing secretion of colony-stimulating factor(s) (csf) in t cells, presumably through the interaction of gp160 with cd4 molecules. in this study, we investigated the gp 160-induced humoral csfs in cord blood by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and by polymerase chain reaction on reverse-transcribed mrna (rt-pcr). we demonstrate that gp160 can induce interleukin (il)-3, il-6, and granulocyte-macrophage csf (gm-csf) protein secretion only in purified cord-blood t cells (cb-t) and not in detectable amounts in whole cord blood cells (wcb); cytokine mrna induction occurred in purified cb-t and wcb, but was significantly greater in the former. treatment of gp160 with soluble cd4 (scd4) abolished the secretion of all three cytokines in cb-t cells, which suggests that interaction of gp160 with cd4 molecules is required for the secretion of these cytokines from cb- t cells. however, in wcb cells, scd4 treatment of gp160 resulted in inhibition of only il-3 and gm-csf mrna, whereas il-6 secretion was enhanced. purified cord-blood monocytes secreted only il-6 in response to gp160, and the gp160-induced il-6 secretion by monocytes was also further increased by gp160 + scd4 complex. furthermore, monocyte culture supernatants suppressed gp160-induced il-3 secretion from cb-t cells. these findings indicate that (1) cb-t cells are a potent source of gp160-induced hematopoietic cytokines, and (2) that different mechanisms are involved in the induction of il-6 by gp160 in the t- and non-t-cell fractions of cord blood. the ability of hiv gp160 to induce hematopoietic csfs in cord blood may be important in hiv pathogenesis.	biology

yellow mite [polyphagotarsonemus latus (banks)], semilooper (anomis sabulifera guen.) and stem weevil (apion corchori marshall) are major economic pests of cultivated jute (corchorus spp.). eighty accessions of corchorus species were evaluated under field infestation, in an augmented randomized block design, against yellow mite, semilooper and stem weevil. based on the damage caused by these pests, accessions wcin-009, wcin-006, nym2860 (c. aestuans); wcij-116 (c. fascicularis); wcij-009, kba-230 (c. tridens); wcij-031 (c. pseudo-capsularis); wcij-121 and wcij-132 (c. trjlocularis) were identified as moderately resistant against one or more of these three pests. it was also found that none of the accessions evaluated showed high level of resistance against all the three pests together. further studies under greenhouse/artificial infestation conditions are required to substantiate the results.	biology

observations of inherited phenotypes that cannot be explained solely through genetic inheritance are increasing. evidence points to transmission of non-dna molecules in the gamete as mediators of the phenotypes. however, in most cases it is unclear what the molecules are, with dna methylation, chromatin proteins, and small rnas being the most prominent candidates. from a screen to generate novel mouse mutants of genes involved in epigenetic reprogramming, we produced a dna methyl- transferase 3b allele that is missing exon 13. mice that are homozygous for the mutant allele have smaller stature and reduced viability, with particularly high levels of female post-natal death. reduced dna methylation was also detected at telocentric repeats and the x-linked hprt gene. however, none of the abnormal phenotypes or dna methylation changes worsened with multiple generations of homozygous mutant inbreeding. this suggests that in our model the abnormalities are reset each generation and the processes of transgenerational epigenetic reprogram- ming are effective in preventing their inheritance.	biology
the crispr/cas9 system has recently been used to confer molecular immunity against several eukaryotic viruses, including plant dna geminiviruses. here, we provide a detailed analysis of the efficiencies of targeting different coding and non-coding sequences in the genomes of multiple geminiviruses. moreover, we analyze the ability of geminiviruses to evade the crispr/cas9 machinery. our results demonstrate that the crispr/cas9 machinery can efficiently target coding and non-coding sequences and interfere with various geminiviruses. furthermore, targeting the coding sequences of different geminiviruses resulted in the generation of viral variants capable of replication and systemic movement. by contrast, targeting the noncoding intergenic region sequences of geminiviruses resulted in interference, but with inefficient recovery of mutated viral variants, which thus limited the generation of variants capable of replication and movement. taken together, our results indicate that targeting noncoding, intergenic sequences provides viral interference activity and significantly limits the generation of viral variants capable of replication and systemic infection, which is essential for developing durable resistance strategies for long-term virus control.	biology

recent advances in genetic engineering have enabled the delivery of clinical trials using patient t cells redirected to recognize tumor-associated antigens. the most dramatic results have been seen with t cells engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (car) specific for cd19, a differentiation antigen expressed in b cells and b lineage malignancies. we propose that antigen expression in nonmalignant cells may contribute to the efficacy of t-cell therapy by maintaining effector function and promoting memory. although car recognition is limited to cell surface structures, t-cell receptors (tcrs) can recognize intracellular proteins. this not only expands the range of tumor-associated self-antigens that are amenable for t-cell therapy, but also allows tcr targeting of the cancer mutagenome. we will highlight biological bottlenecks that potentially limit mutation-specific t-cell therapy and may require high-avidity tcrs that are capable of activating effector function when the concentrations of mutant peptides are low. unexpectedly, modified tcrs with artificially high affinities function poorly in response to low concentration of cognate peptide but pose an increased safety risk as they may respond optimally to cross-reactive peptides. recent gene-editing tools, such as transcription activator–like effector nucleases and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, provide a platform to delete endogenous tcr and hla genes, which removes alloreactivity and decreases immunogenicity of third-party t cells. this represents an important step toward generic off-the-shelf t-cell products that may be used in the future for the treatment of large numbers of patients.	biology
increased interest toward traditional tomato varieties is fueled by the need to rescue desirable organoleptic traits and to improve the quality of fresh and processed tomatoes in the market. in addition, the phenotypic and genetic variation preserved in tomato landraces represents a means to understand the genetic basis of traits related to health and organoleptic aspects and improve them in modern varieties. to establish a framework for this approach, we studied the content of several metabolites in a panel of italian tomato landraces categorized into three broad fruit type classes (flattened/ribbed, pear/oxheart, round/elongate). three modern hybrids, corresponding to the three fruit shape typologies, were included as reference. red ripe fruits were morphologically characterized and biochemically analyzed for their content in glycoalkaloids, phenols, amino acids, and amadori products. the round/elongate types showed a higher content in glycoalkaloids, whereas flattened types had higher levels of phenolic compounds. flattened tomatoes were also rich in total amino acids and in particular in glutamic acid. multivariate analysis of amino acid content clearly separated the three classes of fruit types. making allowance of the very low number of genotypes, phenotype-marker relationships were analyzed after retrieving single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) among the landraces available in the literature. sixty-six markers were significantly associated with the studied traits. the positions of several of these snps showed correspondence with already described genomic regions and qtls supporting the reliability of the association. overall the data indicated that significant changes in quality-related metabolites occur depending on the genetic background in traditional tomato germplasm, frequently according to specific fruit shape categories. such a variability is suitable to harness association mapping for metabolic quality traits using this germplasm as an experimental population, paving the way for investigating their genetic/molecular basis, and facilitating breeding for quality-related compounds in tomato fruits.	biology

the relationship between initial population densities of meloidogyne incognita race and yield of susceptible and resistant tomato cultivars was investigated in the field. microplots were infested with finely chopped nematode infected pepper roots to give a range of population densities of 0.031, 0.062, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, or eggs and juveniles/cm³ soil. a tolerance limit (t) of 0.55 eggs and juveniles of m. incognita/cm³ soil was calculated for both cultivars of tomato. a minimum relative yield (m) of and 0.7 at initial population densities (pi) = eggs and juveniles/cm³ soil was also calculated for the susceptible and resistant tomato cultivar, respectively. fruit size and marketable yield of tomato of the susceptible cultivar were negatively affected by the nematode infestation. maximum nematode reproduction rate was 1,539 at the lowest pi on the susceptible tomato but decreased with increasing nematode population density. reproduction rate was lower that at all initial population densities of m. incognita in microplots planted with the resistant tomato cultivar.	biology
since it was discovered, twenty years ago, the glial fibrillary acidic protein has been the subject of more than publications. the huge interest it has raised up is probably due partly to its abundance in the central nervous system and also, above all, to its cellular specificity which makes it the universally recognized marker of astrocytes. it has been used by biologists as a tool to follow the normal or pathological glia cell differentiation in animal models and human pathology, particularly in the fields of neuropathology and neuro-oncology.	biology
cucullanus pinnai and spinitectus jamundensis are cited parasitizing three freshwater fish species: pimelodus albicans, leporinus obtusidens and prochilodus lineatus, captured in termas de rio hondo pond, province of santiago del estero, argentina, in and 1995. the three fish species were parasited by s. jamundensis, but c. pinnai was found only in p. albicans and l. obtusidens. morphologic and morphometric parasitological studies were carried out. the specimens described were drawned. in addition, the following parasitic infection indexes were calculated: prevalence, mean and maximum intensity. the two nematode species identified are described for the first time in argentina and increased the host range cited for the parasite species studied in this work.	biology
the igg subclass distribution for both anca-specific, and total igg subclasses, of sera from patients with active systemic vasculitis was determined by solid-phase assay using monoclonal anti-human subclass reagents. to control for varying performance of the subclass reagents, the assays were calibrated with sera affinity-depleted into subclass specific fractions, whose anca igg subclass distribution was determined by a common reagent. in patients whose anca persisted during clinical remission, the anca igg subclass distributions between active and remission phases of disease were compared. the total igg subclass distribution of sera from patients with active vasculitis was similar to that found in a normal population. the anca igg subclass distribution of the same sera showed relative enrichment for igg3 and depletion of igg2 (p less than 0.05). when the active and clinical remission anca igg subclass distributions were compared, anca igg3 levels had fallen and anca igg2 levels were increased during remission (p less than 0.01).	biology
twenty-five strains of escherichia coli isolated from turkeys were characterized for their serum resistance and virulence. an in vitro bactericidal assay was used to determine the serum resistance of e coli. virulence was determined by survival time after iv inoculation of each strain into 3-week-old turkeys. serum-resistant e coli strains were generally found to be virulent for turkeys, whereas serum-sensitive e coli strains were avirulent. of the strains, strains were placed in the categories of serum-resistant/virulent and serum-sensitive/avirulent. five strains were serum-resistant and avirulent, and strains were serum-sensitive and virulent. serum resistance appears to be an important determinant of virulence for e coli in turkeys; however, the requirement for other virulence factors, in addition to serum resistance, was suggested by the finding that serum-resistant strains were avirulent in turkeys.	biology

the pattern of immunoglobulin (ig) gene rearrangement and the genomic structure of the myc locus were investigated in the dna of lymphnode biopsies of patients suffering from lymphoadenopathy-associated syndrome (las) and from patients with burkitt's lymphoma. although polyclonality was the prevalent pattern of ig gene rearrangement observed in las, in 30% of the cases discrete bands of ig heavy chain gene rearrangement were identifiable due to the presence of monoclonal or oligoclonal cell populations. however, structural alterations of the myc gene were not detected in any cases. as expected, in all three burkitt's lymphomas studied, the lymphnode dna displayed a clonal pattern of ig heavy chain gene rearrangement. the myc was altered in two cases, which presented a truncation of the gene beginning within a very short region of the first intron. by contrast, the breakpoint positions on chromosome mapped in different regions of the ig loci, which in both cases involved the switch (sh) area. data confirm the relatively common occurrence of oligoclonal expansions within b cells in las and the frequent involvement of the myc oncogene in the process of lymphomagenesis in individuals positive for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv).	biology
to evaluate whether pretreatment with prostaglandin e2 (pge2) could desensitize pepsinogen secretion in chief cells from guinea pig, chief cells were pretreated with microm pge2 for up to min. desensitization of subsequent pge2-stimulated secretion was maximal after min, averaging only +/- 9% (se) of pepsinogen secretion in control cells stimulated with microm pge2. desensitization was half-maximal with nm pge2. pge2 pretreatment at degrees c did not cause desensitization. in cells pretreated with microm pge2 for min and then given min to recover, responsiveness increased to +/- 7% of that for control cells stimulated with pge2. thus the desensitization was reversible. pretreatment with pgd2 and pgf2a did not alter subsequent pge2-mediated secretion. pge2-induced desensitization was heterologous but mediator specific because pepsinogen secretion was reduced in response to adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (camp)-mediated agents (secretin and vasoactive intestinal peptide) but not ca(2+)-mediated agents (cck-8, gastrin, or carbachol). pretreating chief cells with microm pge2 did not significantly alter camp generation in response to pge2, secretin, or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, suggesting that desensitization was not mediated by an alteration in the receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase system. because pge2 pretreatment also desensitized pepsinogen secretion induced by the synthetic camp analogues 8-brcamp and 2'-o-monobutyryl-8-brcamp, it is likely that the ability of pge2 to desensitize pepsinogen secretion in chief cells isolated from guinea pig is due to a mechanism distal to generation of camp.	biology

reports have shown an increased occurrence of bacterial infections due to the rapid development of multi-drug resistant strains of bacteria. in this regard, lots of efforts are being made to discover new drugs. medicinal plants have played an important role in drug discovery. multiple-plant herbal concoctions (multi-component herbal concoctions) are used as remedies in many cultures around the world. this is due to the advantages of synergism and low dosage of active principles compared with singleplant herbal remedies. an aqueous concoction obtained from a combination of leaves of psidium. guajava, acacia albidia and ficus exasperata is used for the treatment of bacterial infections amongst many tribes in northern ghana. in the present study, aqueous extracts of p. guajava, a. albidia and f. exasperata were screened separately for phytochemicals and their bacterial growth inhibitory activity evaluated in vitro using the agar diffusion method with escherichia coli and salmonella typhi as test organisms. the result was compared with that of an aqueous concoction obtained from a combination of the three plants (multicomponent concoction) to determine any indication of synergism or additive effect. ciprofloxacin was used as control. phytochemical screening of the extracts revealed the presence of phytochemicals with reported antimicrobial activities. all the extracts exhibited antibacterial activity with the multi-component extract demonstrating a superior antibacterial property against the test organisms at concentrations ranging between 1.0-5.0 mg/ml. the antibacterial activity of the multi-component concoction was statistically not significantly different from that of ciporfloxacin (p = 0.87). there was no indication of synergism or additive effect in the multi-component concoction.	biology

western-blotting technique and computer programme have been used to analyse cellular antigenic patterns of coagulase-negative staphylococci mainly of s. epidermidis and s. saprophyticus species. it was shown that antigenic pattern among strains of one species was similar. intra strains differences are mainly quantitative. the qualitative differences concern not quantitatively dominant antigens. the main antigens of s. epidermidis and s. saprophyticus strains were of and kd molecular weight respectively. the antigens of molecular weight around and kd were detected in antigenic extract of strains from different species. only one of the quantitatively dominant antigen of m. w. kd, was localised in all analysed materials. the method presented here was used for the first time to analyse staphylococcal antigens. such analysis could be performed not only for bacterial antigens.	biology
in a survey in some symptoms were observed on three olive trees in a collection of different olive cultivars in one of the central provinces in iran (yazd province). affected trees exhibited a variable range of symptoms: dwarfing, shoot proliferation, internode shortening, small leaves, leaf rolling, abortive buds, appearance of very small shoots, hypertrophied, and die- back. the possibility of association of a phytoplasma with the disease was evaluated using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). total dna was extracted from midribs of symptomatic and healthy olive plants using phytoplasma enriched procedure and tested for the presence of phytoplasma by nested-pcr using phytoplasmal- universal primers r16f2/r16r2, followed by primers fu5/ru3 which amplify and 880bp dna fragments of 16srdna, respectively. pcr resulted in amplification of expected dna fragments in symptomatic but not in healthy olive by both primer pairs. on the basis of symptoms and positive reaction in pcr, these plants can be infected with a phytoplasma. this is the first report of olive trees phytoplasmal disease in iran. identification of the agent and its comparison with other phytoplasmal isolates reported from other plants (hosts) in iran are being studied. based on the quarantine requirements, one of these trees was eradicated and two of them were transplanted in an isolated green house for further studies.	biology
with the development of technology and space exploration, studies on long-duration space flights have shown that microgravity induces damage to multiple organs, including the dorsal root ganglia (drg). however, very little is known about the effects of long-term microgravity on drg neurons. this study investigated the effects of microgravity on lumbar (l5) drg neurons in rats using the hindlimb unweighting (hu) model. male (m) and female (f) sprague-dawley rats were randomly divided into m- and f-control (con) groups and m- and f-hu groups, respectively (n = 10). at the end of hu treatment for weeks, morphological changes were detected. myelin basic protein (mbp) and degenerated myelin basic protein (dgen-mbp) expressions were analyzed by immunofluorescence and western blot assays. glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (gdnf) protein and mrna expressions were also analyzed by immunohistochemistry, western blot, and rt-pcr analysis, respectively. compared with the corresponding con groups, the hu groups exhibited slightly loose junctions between drg neurons, some separated ganglion cells and satellite cells, and lightly stained nissl bodies that were of smaller size and had a scattered distribution. high levels of dgen-mbp and low mbp expressions were appeared and gdnf expressions were significantly decreased in both hu groups. changes were more pronounced in the f-hu group than in the m-hu group. in conclusion, hu treatment induced damage of l5 drg neurons, which was correlated with decreased total mbp protein expression, increased dgen-mbp expression, and reduced gdnf protein and mrna expression. importantly, these changes were more severe in f-hu rats compared with m-hu rats.	biology
aim to establish a sybr green i quantitative real-time pcr method for detecting the expression of the tlr4 mrna of mice and to monitor the dynamics for tlr4 mrna level of mice bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (dc) in the process of the maturation and the effect of dexamethasone (dex) on tlr4 expression. methods (1) dc from mice bone marrow were induced by cytokines and separated by magnetic beads. (2) the combined plasmid pucm-t/tlr4 and pucm-t/beta-actin for the standard materials in the real-time pcr was reconstructed. (3) the dynamics for the express tlr4 mrna of dc cultivated in vitro for days was detected respectively. (4) the tlr4 mrna expression between dc treated with or without dex was detected and compared. results (1) the dc with the purity over 90% were fully separated in success. (2) a sybr green i quantitative real-time pcr method for analyzing the tlr4 mrna expression level of the mice was successful established. (3) tlr4 mrna level was stable early during the culture of dc and then rise obviously at last. conclusion there exists a close relationship between the level of tlr4 mrna and the period of maturation of dc and the expression of tlr4 could be increased by dex.	biology
we sequenced a bp fragment including the trna thr , trna pro gene and the first half of the control region from wild and cultured olive flounder specimens from korea. out of nucleotide sites, (9.4%) were variable, haplotypes being found. most haplotypes are unique in the wild population and only four were shared by cultured specimins. the nucleotide diversity and differences between wild and cultured populations were 0.025±0.013 and 0.015±0.008, and 12.94±6.00 and 7.83±3.75, respectively. haplotype diversity was 0.98±0.02 and 0.49±0.09 in the wild and cultured populations, respectively. these results show that marked reductions of genetic variability in the hatchery strains were observed in the number of mitochondrial dna haplotypes and haplotype diversity when compared to the wild populations. furthermore, we detected significant population differentiation between both populations. the mtdna sequencing technique used to evaluate the genetic variability of hatchery strains compared to that of the wild population is potential for genetic monitoring of olive flounder hatchery stocks.	biology
piglet plasma insulin (i), cortisol (c), triiodothyronine (t3) and tetraiodothyronine (t4) levels have been studied for their dynamics depending on the age and metabolic energy in ration of pregnant sows. the considerable changes occur in the concentration of adaptive hormones in the piglet blood during hours after birth. the level of insulin in the piglet blood during the first day increases from 1.1 +/- 0.18 to 27.4 +/- 5.9 mku/ml, whereas c, t3, t4 levels sharply decrease. there are no considerable differences in hormone concentration in the blood of older (5- and 21-day) piglets. it is established that insulin concentration in the blood of piglets increases and times by the 12th hours, respectively, after feeding pregnant sows with the ration containing nutrient animal fat. the 3- and 2-fold increase of t3 and t4 levels, respectively, was observed in the blood of newborn piglets from sows which received high fat ration. the influence of metabolic energy in the ration of pregnant sows at the level of t3 and t4 in the piglet blood also takes place at the later stages of neonatal development. it is supposed that piglets, whose mothers received extracaloric rations are more viable because of the changes in hormonal status in the neonatal period.	biology
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc) is one of the most prevalent neoplasms worldwide. while numerous potent dietary insults were considered as oncogenic players for hnscc development, the impact of metabolic imbalance was less emphasized during hnscc carcinogenesis. previous preclinical and epidemiological investigations showed that dm could possibly be correlated with greater incidence and poorer prognosis in hnscc patients; however, the outcomes from different groups are contradictive and underlying mechanisms remains elusive. in the present study, the changes of cellular malignancy in response to prolonged glucose incubation in hnscc cells were examined. the results demonstrated that hyperglycemia enhanced hnscc cell malignancy over time through suppression of cell differentiation, promotion of cell motility, increased resistance to cisplatin, and up-regulation of the nutrient-sensing akt/ampk-mtorc1 pathway. further analysis showed that a more aggressive tongue neoplastic progression was found under dm conditions compared to non-dm state whereas dm pathology led to a higher percentage of cervical lymph node metastasis and poorer prognosis in hnscc patients. taken together, the present study confirms that hyperglycemia and dm could enhance hnscc malignancy and the outcomes are of great benefit in providing better anti-cancer treatment strategy for dm patients with hnscc.	biology

abstract many of the blood-borne xenobiotics which result in injury to the lung are not inherently pneumotoxic but cause damage within the target cells following metabolic activation. this injury is usually restricted to those cells capable of bioactivation and thus, in addition to its clinical significance, it provides a valuable indicator of the normal metabolic activity within the numerous cell types present in lung. not surprisingly, injury does not simply reflect the presence or absence of a particular enzyme but rather the balance between mechanisms for activation and deactivation. a change in the balance between different enzymes may also determine whether activation results in injury or tumorigenesis (foster et al. 1992). changes in particular types of cells cannot be determined by analysing whole lung homogenates. isolation of particular cell types can provide valuable information but this approach does not address the differences between adjacent cells of the same type (forkert & moussa 1989; dinsdale et al. 1992). further progress may require the correlation of the injury with the status of individual cells; the quantitation of histochemical and immunocytochemical data is notoriously labour intensive but this approach may well be inescapable.	biology
the distortion of morphopoiesis or tail attachment to the capsid is a characteristic feature of morphogenetical development not only of a reproductive infection but also of the lysogenic induction of the defective bacteriophage erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora (ecc). a model system for studying morphogenetical development and assembling of the virion was created on the basis of the phage zf40 and its two virulent mutants zf40-421 and zf40(5/5), as well as the indicator culture ecc m2-4/50 r1 being nontraditional host for these phages. it has helped to establish that the diameter of the phage capsid is not a conservative value. the presence of capsids of two types with the average diameters 60.3 and 65.0 nm is characteristic of the virmutant zf40c(5/5)/50ri, while in the course of morphogenesis the phage zf40-421/50ri forms only one type of heads of nm in size. these heads are probably not firmly connected to the tails since the degree of the secondary destruction of the virions of the phage zf40-421/50ri is considerably higher, than that of the virions of the phage zf40c(5/5)/50ri. the number of capsids being 60.3 nm in diameter prevails considerably in the latter. the both virulent mutants as a whole are essentially more stable than their isogenic partners obtained on ecc rc5297 which helps to make a conclusion about considerable influence of specific bacterial proteins of the host-cell on morphogenesis and morphopoiesis.	biology
breeding to increase crop resistance is a common strategy to decrease damage caused by insect pests, especially in the current context where insecticides are becoming at the same time less accepted by society and less efficient because of widespread pest resistance. the main bottleneck of this strategy is phenotyping. although simple, high-throughput methods have been proposed which could be highly useful, they may raise conceptual issues. using field and laboratory experiments on oilseed rape (brassica napus) and the pollen beetle (brassicogethes aeneus syn. meligethes aeneus), we illustrated possible difficulties with this approach: (i) field screenings might not represent the real attractiveness of the tested genotypes; (ii) plant phenology or spatial organization of the genotypes might bias field screening results; (iii) experiments based on detached plant parts (here, single flower buds or anthers) might not allow to infer the plant-insect relationship of the whole plant. we propose ways to better take these risks into account.	biology
results of clinico-morphological and immunohistochemical studies of cases of carcinosarcoma of the uterus are presented in an attempt to provide pathogenetic rationale for prognosticators of the disease. immunohistochemical reactions were used to evaluate the expression of genes and mediators p53 and pten and cyclooxigenase (cox-2) in cells of mesenchyme and epithelium of tumor to gauge the influence of either component on its biological behavior. all patients were divided into two groups depending on whether they revealed expression of p53, pten and cyclooxigenase or not. the end results--overall survival and complete remission duration--were compared in both groups. no dominance of either component of carcinosarcoma was established.	biology
beta 2-adrenergic receptors, which are encoded on chromosome 5q32-34, belong to the group of g-protein-linked hormone receptors with seven transmembrane domains. upon agonist binding, adenylate cyclase is activated. although the function of human leukocyte beta-adrenergic receptors is unknown, these cells are often used as a model system to study tissue beta-adrenergic receptors. in intact mononuclear leukocytes or membrane preparations, 1000-3000 beta 2-adrenergic receptors are found, having an antagonist affinity constant (kd) in the range of pm. beta-adrenergic receptor numbers are different in leukocyte subsets, with receptor density higher in b than in t cells. cd56+ or cd57+ natural killer cells express more receptors than cd8+ or cd4+ cells. kd is higher in cd8+ than in cd4+ cells. acute sympathetic activation by isoproterenol infusion or short-lasting exercise leads to an increased number of mononuclear beta-adrenergic receptors with a slightly reduced proportion of those with high agonist affinity. acute sympathetic activation by adrenaline infusion, short-term exercise, or psychological stress also causes a selective increase in circulating cd56+ or cd57+ lymphocytes which are rich in beta-adrenergic receptors. the results of several studies suggest that adrenaline-induced changes in beta-adrenergic receptors and the redistribution of leukocyte subsets may be linked. beta-adrenergic receptors may mediate immuno-modulatory effects by causing selective cell mobilization.	biology

during the past twenty years it has become increasingly clear that biological membranes, like other cellular constituents, are under genetic control. each membrane protein, and each enzyme required for the synthesis of membrane lipids, is now presumed to be coded for by a structural gene, whose nucleotide sequence determines the corresponding amino acid sequence of the protein. in addition, at least in some instances, regulatory genes exist which control the timing and rate of expression of the structural genes. as a result, the investigator interested in membrane transport mechanisms has access to a powerful analytical method. genetic mutation can cause the specific loss — or even the specific alteration, one amino acid at a time — of a transport system, giving the investigator a chance to study the physiological consequences of the change.	biology

mosquitofi sh (gambusia) are sexually dimorphic; adult males have an elongation of the anal fi n to form a copulatory structure known as a gonopodium. several studies since the early 1980s have reported elongated anal fi ns in female mosquitofi sh exposed to pulp and paper mill discharge, a phenomenon known as masculinization. although adverse impacts have been suggested in these previous reports, the infl uence of masculinization on reproductive success has not been assessed for pulp mill effl uent-exposed eastern mosquitofi sh (gambusia holbrooki or affi nis). the current study compared fecundity (number of fry per female at parturition) to an index of masculinization (ratio of anal fi n rays to 6). pregnant females were collected from two effl uent-receiving streams in florida: rice creek and the fenholloway river, over two reproductive seasons (2003 and 2004). masculinization was consistent between years, with clear effects at the fenholloway river site, while the response was minimal or nondetectable at the rice creek site. masculinization was not correlated with the production of fry/fecundity at either site. data suggest differing reproductive seasonal strategies between basins and populations but do not demonstrate any effects of pulp and paper exposure on reproductive success in mosquitofi sh.	biology

using the whole cotyledonary node as explants, a rapid and efficient regeneration protocol was established for kenaf ( hibiscus cannabinus l.) on murashige and skoog (ms) basal medium. the effects of the plant growth regulators: n6-benzyladenine (ba), indole-3-aceticacid (iaa) and the non-ironic surfactant pluronic f-68 (f-68) on shoot regeneration were evaluated by the orthogonal design l16 (4 ). the best combination for shoot regeneration was ms medium supplemented with 5.0 mg l -1 ba, 0.3 mg l - iaa and 0.2% (m/v) f-68. the maximum number of shoots per explant and the frequency of shoot regeneration were 12.97 and 100%, respectively, after cultivation for days. the results indicated that ba had the greatest contribution on shoot inducing, followed by f-68, and iaa showed no significant effect on shoot formation. furthermore, 0.5 ~ 2.0 mgl -1 of iaa and 1-naphthyleneacetic acid (naa) were used respectively for root induction. more than roots were obtained on ms medium supplemented with 2.0 mgl -1 of iaa after culturing for days. iaa was more effective than naa on root induction. according to this method, the plantlets could be obtained within months and showed no morphological difference from those naturally grown plants. this protocol could be used for kenaf genetic improvement by agrobacterium mediated transformation. keywords: kenaf, hibiscus cannabinus l., cotyledonary node, shoot regeneration, rooting	biology
hominis placenta has a broad array of clinical applications in korean medicine, including treatment of inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. the purpose of this study is to explore the global gene expression profiles in human raw 264.7 cell lines treated with hominis placenta herbal-acupuncture solution (hphas) using microarray analysis. the raw 264.7 cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (lps), hphas, or both. of the 8,170 genes profiled in this study, with a cut-off level of two-fold change in the expression, genes (ctd1, regulating synaptic membrane exocytosis etc.) were upregulated and genes (splicing factor, arginine/serine-rich actinin, alpha etc.) downregulated following lps treatment. one gene (acrosin) was upregulated and genes (phospholipase a2, group ib, neurofilament, heavy polypeptide 200kda, etc.) were downregulated following hphas treatment. eleven genes (rab27a, member ras oncogene family, eosinophil peroxidase, etc.) were upregulated and genes (v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog g (avian), rw1 protein, etc.) were downregulated following co-stimulation of hphas and lps. it is thought that microarrays will play an ever-growing role in the advance of our understanding of the pharmacological actions of hphas in the treatment of arthritis. further studies, however, are required to concretely prove the effectiveness of hphas.	biology
both translation arrest and proteasome stress associated with accumulation of ubiquitin-conjugated protein aggregates were considered as a cause of delayed neuronal death after transient global brain ischemia; however, exact mechanisms as well as possible relationships are not fully understood. the aim of this study was to compare the effect of chemical ischemia and proteasome stress on cellular stress responses and viability of neuroblastoma sh-sy5y and glioblastoma t98g cells. chemical ischemia was induced by transient treatment of the cells with sodium azide in combination with 2-deoxyglucose. proteasome stress was induced by treatment of the cells with bortezomib. treatment of sh-sy5y cells with sodium azide/2-deoxyglucose for min was associated with cell death observed h after treatment, while glioblastoma t98g cells were resistant to the same treatment. treatment of both sh-sy5y and t98g cells with bortezomib was associated with cell death, accumulation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins, and increased expression of hsp70. these typical cellular responses to proteasome stress, observed also after transient global brain ischemia, were not observed after chemical ischemia. finally, chemical ischemia, but not proteasome stress, was in sh-sy5y cells associated with increased phosphorylation of eif2α, another typical cellular response triggered after transient global brain ischemia. our results showed that short chemical ischemia of sh-sy5y cells is not sufficient to induce both proteasome stress associated with accumulation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins and stress response at the level of heat shock proteins despite induction of cell death and eif2α phosphorylation.	biology
day-old broiler chicks (150) were randomly distributed into groups of each. five dietary treatments having maize (100%)-m, maize (33%) + sorghum (33%) + finger millet (33%)-msf, maize (33%) + sorghum (33%) + pearl millet (33%)-msp, maize (33%) + pearl millet (33%) + finger millet (33%)-mpf and maize (25%) + sorghum (25%) + pearl millet (25%) + finger millet (25%)-mspf at fixed calori:protein ratio for 0–4 weeks starter and 4–7 weeks finisher phase were prepared. each experimental diet was offered ad lib as mash to three groups of chicks from 0–7 weeks of age. during 0–7 weeks of age, the diets having a combination of sorghum and pearl millet (msp) or sorghum, finger millet and pearl millet (mspf) with maize resulted in similar body weight gain, feed intake and fcr, while the combinations of finger millet with sorghum (msf) or pearl millet (mpf) caused lower (p<0.05) gain in body weight than the maize based control diet (m). feed intake remained statistically similar among all the dietaiy treatments during this period. however, fcr was poorer (p<0.05) in diet msf than the other diets. gross energy and dm metabolizability and nitrogen retention did not differ among dietaiy treatments. the eviscerated yields also did not differ due to dietary treatments. the feed cost of production/kg gain or meat (rs) was lower in diets msp, mpf and mspf than maize based control diet m. it was inferred that a combination of maize, pearl millet and sorghum @ 33% each or maize, pearl millet, sorghum and finger millet @ 25% each in diet of broilers could support the optimum growth and feed conversion efficiency without affecting nutrient utilization and meat yield.	biology

methods are disclosed for enhancing protein production. one method comprises preparing a vector by inserting a gene encoding ubiquitin in front of a gene encoding a protein of interest and inserting the vector into a cell. a fusion protein will be expressed which includes ubiquitin plus the protein of interest. ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolases can cleave the fusion protein leaving the desired protein in its free state. this method causes enhanced production of the protein of interest as compared to performing the same method without the ubiquitin gene as part of the vector. a ubiquitin promoter is unnecessary to yield this enhanced production and is not used. a second method is very similar except that in place of a ubiquitin gene, a gene encoding fourteen amino acids of cucumber mosaic virus coat protein is inserted in front of the gene of interest. this results in expression of a fusion protein comprising the fourteen amino acid residues of the coat protein bonded to the protein of interest. the fusion protein is produced at a higher level than is the protein when the coat protein gene fragment is not present in the vector. in both methods the genes can be placed under the control of heterologous promoters such as a 35s promoter.	biology
a plastic-adherent mononuclear cell population in human bone marrow produces non-plastic-adherent nucleated cells in liquid cultures. these cells can be harvested from the culture medium and a proportion of them can be identified as granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells (gm-cfc) by plating them in semi-solid cultures with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf). the generation of gm-cfc from their plastic-adherent precursors can be amplified considerably by adding conditioned medium (cm) to the liquid phase of the adherent cell cultures. this effect of cm cannot be reproduced by recombinant (r) gm-csf or interleukins (ils) or if they are added singly to the culture medium. in contrast, the combination of gm-csf + il-1 equalled or surpassed the activity of cm. the combinations of rgm-csf + ril-3 and rgm-csf + il-6 also mimicked the activity of cm but less effectively than gm-csf + il-1.	biology

dendritic cells (dcs), which can shape their functions depending on the microenvironment, are crucial for the delicate balance of immunity and tolerance during pregnancy. however, the mechanism underlying the microenvironment-educated plasticity of dc differentiation during pregnancy remains largely unclear. here, we found that the differentiation of conventional dcs (cdcs) and plasmacytoid dcs (pdcs) is regulated in a tissue-specific manner during pregnancy. the ratio of cdcs and pdcs remained constant in the spleen. however, the ratio changed in the para-aortic lymph nodes (lns), where cdc percentages were significantly reduced concurrent with an increase in pdcs from e8.5 to e16.5. moreover, the expansion of pdcs and t regulatory (treg) cells was correlated in the para-aortic lns, and pdcs had more potential to induce regulatory t cells (tregs) compared with cdcs (independent of ido expression). notably, the balance between cdcs and pdcs is disrupted in ifn-γ-induced abnormal pregnancy, accompanied by lower treg percentages in the para-aortic lns and decidua. to further identify the underlying mechanism, we found that elevated ifn-γ can increase the levels of gm-csf to alter the differentiation of pdcs into cdcs in vivo. therefore, we provide a novel regulatory mechanism underlying pregnancy-related immune tolerance that involves the balance of dc subsets, which may offer a new target for the prevention of human spontaneous abortion.	biology
as one of the most elaborate and diverse sexual signals, bird songs are prominent among mate choice criteria. females generally prefer mates with larger repertoire size, which promotes the evolution of song complexity. however, there are also some songbirds that have far simpler and less diverse vocalizations, which have not been the focus of scientific scrutiny. most phylloscopus warblers are accomplished singers with complex songs. in contrast, hume’s warbler (p. humei) has extremely simple songs. in order to explore the song’s function, its evolutionary significance and particularly to assess its possible relationship with parental investment, we studied mate choice of the subspecies p. h. mandellii in lianhuashan national nature reserve, gansu, china. we recorded body measurements and songs of breeding males and then explored their relationships with the date of clutch initiation, reasoning that the characteristics of males that are involved with early nesting activities reflect female mate preferences. we also recorded egg size and body measurements of nestlings to assess the relationship between parental investment and mate choice. we found that male wing and tail lengths were positively correlated with early clutch initiation as were songs characterized by short duration and rapid rise to maximum amplitude. we also found that early-breeding females did not lay large eggs, but produced more surviving young, which grew up faster. female mate choice criteria in this bird include both visual signals and song characteristics. our study supports the hypothesis that females may judge male quality from quite subtle differences. in order to reduce the risk of predation, a preference for such inconspicuous male characteristics may be partially driven by high vulnerability of this warbler to predators as a ground-nesting species.	biology

hemorrhagic mucosal lesions are produced during intestinal ischemia and after reperfusion due at least in part to the accumulation and activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the tissue. it has been shown in vitro that adenosine is instrumental in attenuating this pathophysiological process. acadesine [5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide (aica) riboside], a purine nucleoside analogue, increases the availability of adenosine in the tissue. the aim of the study was therefore to assess the influence of acadesine treatment on neutrophil accumulation, purine metabolism, and mucosal damage after intestinal ischemia and reperfusion. intestinal ischemia was induced in cats by partial occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery for h. samples of the small intestine were exercised before and at the end of the hypotensive period as well as and min after reperfusion. conjugated dienes, myeloperoxidase, and reduced and oxidized glutathione, as well as the purine metabolites, were determined in the tissue samples. the tissue was also examined histologically. six cats received saline, and six cats were treated initially before ischemia with acadesine (2.5 mg/kg body wt i.v.) over min as a bolus. thereafter, acadesine (0.5 mg.kg-1.min- i.v.) was given continuously during ischemia and min after reperfusion. acadesine treatment significantly attenuated the mucosal lesions seen during reperfusion. this improvement was due at least in part to the inhibition of neutrophil accumulation, as judged by low myeloperoxidase levels. the prevention of neutrophil activation resulted most likely from increased adenosine concentrations in the intestinal tissue in the early reperfusion period.(abstract truncated at words)	biology

proc amer assoc cancer res, volume glucocorticoid hormones have a variety of important functions in eucaryotic cells and tissues; they usually promote cell differentiation and inhibit proliferation. it is known that glucocorticoids have an inhibitory effect on androgen-independent prostate carcinoma (pc) cell growth in vitro and in vivo. the glucocorticoid control of cellular functions is mediated via glucocorticoid receptor (gr), a well-known transcription factor. in this work we characterized the effect of gr on prostate development and prostate cell proliferation in transgenic mice overexpressing gr in basal epithelial cells of prostate. to quantitatively characterize the mouse prostate morphology we performed the analysis of the luminal bridging that reflects the complexity of prostate gland. we found that in both lobes of prostate of adult k5.gr transgenic males the luminal bridging was significantly decreased. in dorsolateral prostate of k5.gr mice the number of glands with luminal bridging was three times lower than in prostate of w.t. littermates. in ventral mouse prostate the luminal bridging is more common finding. thus, we have compared the average number of luminal bridging /gland, and found that the luminal bridging was more than 2.5 times decreased in k5.gr transgenics in comparison with w.t. littermates. in addition, we have evaluated the proliferation rate in prostate glands using brdu immunostaining. we found the statistically significant two-fold decrease of the number of brdu-positive cells in both lobes of prostate glands in k5.gr-transgenic mice. these data indicate that gr plays an important role in regulation of prostate development and proliferation.	biology
factors effecting foraging behaviors of trigona collina in a mixed deciduous forest at phitsanulok nature education center and phuhinrongkla national park were investigated in twelve colonies during november and april 2004. the results showed that physical factors (temperature, relative humidity and light intensity) effect the beginning time for foraging. stingless bees began to forage when the temperature was ๐c with 0-0.001 k.lux of light intensity and 95% relative humidity. foragers’ activity was relatively high in a range of temperature from ๐c to ๐c and at 75% relative humidity. number of foraging bees had the positive correlation with light intensity in the range of 2-6 k.lux and gradually decreased with the increasing of light intensity. the foraging behavior was consistent during the sunrise period with the highest pollen loads between 9.30 a.m. and 11.30 a.m. keywords: foraging behaviors, stingless bees, trigona collina and physical/abiotic factors	biology
to study the metabolic fate of l-histidine and histamine in rat isolated enterocytes, enterocytes were incubated in the presence of 0.1 mm l-[u-14c] histidine. at the rate of 11.1 +/- 2.7 pmol/10(6) cells/30 min, the amino acid was incorporated into cellular proteins. microm cycloheximide, i.e. a protein synthesis inhibitor, inhibited this incorporation by +/- 17%. l-histidine was used for cellular protein synthesis which depended on time and concentration. 0.1 mm l-[u-14c] histidine was little oxidized by intestinal cells, i.e. 0.12 +/- 0.06 pmol/10(6) cells/30 min, and was not converted into histamine. when mm histamine was added to the incubation medium, it completely inhibited the incorporation of 0.1 mm [1,4-14c] putrescine into isolated enterocytes. in enterocyte homogenates, this corresponded to inhibition by histamine of putrescine incorporation as catalyzed by transglutaminase activity. since histamine incorporation into tca-precipitable material derived from enterocyte homogenates depended on time and concentration, we concluded that exogenous, but not de novo-formed histamine was able to compete with putrescine incorporation into enterocytes as catalyzed by transglutaminase activity.	biology
the purpose of these studies was to examine an early carcinogen-induced change in primary human epithelial cell cultures and to attempt to reverse this change with retinoic acid. pnmary cultures of human foreskin keratinocytes were prepared and exposed to the carcinogen, propane sultone. after each passage, a portion of cells were plated into medium containing increasing amounts of calcium. in a series of experiments it became evident that carcinogen exposed cells continued to grow in the presence of added calcium. solvent control cell growth was decreased under such conditions. this new phenotype became apparent after the third subculture, but was pronounced after the fourth subculture. the addition of retinoic acid to the culture medium at each medium change reduced this effect and the keratinocytes grew more slowly, similar to control cells, in the presence of added calcium. the results suggest that carcinogen-exposed human keratinocytes acquire a resistance to calcium-induced differentiation or growth cessation and that retinoic acid can ameliorate this process. although the mechanism of retinoic acid's inhibition remains unclear, these studies do provide a human cell model system which can be used to screen potential chemopreventive agents and for further mechanistic research.	biology

"since the late 1980s, when her band the sugarcubes became known internationally, singer-songwriter bjork, the most famous icelander since leif eriksson, has been met with both praise and criticism, almost always directed at her difference from westerners, pop musicians, adults, and even humans. biographer mark pytlik recalls the press around her album debut: ""nearly every new story paraded her otherness, lionized her differences, and positioned her as an outsider operating as a slave to her ever-changing emotional state."" (1) this persona was not entirely a figment of non-icelandic journalists' imaginations: bjork had circulated select facets of iceland's nationalist image/tourist imagery to contextualize her innovative blend of punk, pop, avant-garde, and electronic dance music with its themes of nature, sensuality, emotional intensity, and quirky curiosity. however, journalists turned her creative inspirations into essentialist metaphors, describing her emotions as ""volcanic"" and her appearance as ""elfish"" and including ""ice"" among her ""viking"" compositional tools. (2) against her intentions, bjork was set up as the ultimate other--nonhuman, childish, hysterical, and ""someone even men wanted to mother."" (3) bjork is indeed one of the most imaginative and unusual popular musicians of her time, but labeling her as an outsider and her music as fancifully but meaninglessly quirky misses one of her tantalizing projects: bjork musically defamiliarizes western cultural archetypes from within. she compels listeners to experience the whimsical performativity or infuriating constructedness of roles and situations that we may take for granted. in a famous early song, she plays a (seemingly child, alien, or animal) anthropologist who studies ""human behavior,"" singing, ""if you ever get close to a human and human behavior ... be ready to get confused"" (my emphasis). (4) journalist alex ross explains the irony of the song: ""it was a career-defining move: bjork positioned herself as a figure outside convention--as a member of another species, even--while using the second person to implicate the listener in the conspiracy."" (5) by involving listeners in the critique, she invites her audience to identify with her denaturalizing performances rather than see her artistic persona(e) as ""other."" understanding this aesthetic helps contextualize her gender performances, which resist normative sexualized feminine stereotypes yet also thoughtfully embody select female archetypes, playing on feminist perspectives ranging from equality to difference and occasionally even essentialism. femininity and motherhood have proven awkward territory for academic feminism and queer theory, which have focused (for at least the last thirty years) on the social construction and performance of gender and sex, centering on antinormativity. contemporary theorists typically critique mainstream depictions of motherhood for essentialism, heteronormativity, and biased assumptions that motherhood and particularly pregnancy are central to all women's identities. however, as feminist literary scholar susan fraiman argues, queer theories that reject femininity and motherhood outright while prizing masculinity and androgyny as ""cool"" and progressive replicate centuries-old sexism. (6) bjork's ""alien anthropologist"" interpretations of femininity and motherhood provide productive working examples of critically navigating these issues personally, artistically, and politically. this article addresses the interconnections between bjork's explorations of both essentialism and identity performance as she conveyed icelandic nationalism and then later invoked its icons in metaphors of world unity and peace; (7) simultaneously represented female sensuality and motherly nurturing, thus challenging the western asexual mother stereotype; and combined these interests in feminist critique of the patriarchal culture of war by examining terrorism and the ""war on terror"" through frames of motherhood. …"	sociology
purpose – a set of principal parameters (i.e. time, context, gap, outcome, and consequence) influences the ethical performance evaluation (epe) of business practices in the marketplace and society. the purpose of this paper is to describe a managerial framework of epe based upon these parameters. design/methodology/approach – case illustrations are used to underpin the introduced managerial framework of epe. findings – the epe of business practices is not only dependent upon the ethical values and principles of today, but those principles of tomorrow may be equally, or even more, crucial. the epe of business practices is also dependent upon the surrounding context and its specific ethical values and principles. furthermore, it is dependent upon the gap between different perceptions of ethical values and principles and if the outcome of the corporation's ethical values and principles are proactive or reactive in relation to the reigning ethical values and principles in the marketplace and society. finally, it is also dependent upon the potential and eventual consequences of ethical values and principles. research limitations/implications – the only way that we can “objectively” evaluate past ethical values and principles is through the use of ethical values and principles at the time and in respect to the context at hand. research tends to fail when considering the longitudinal and evolutionary dimensions in the exploration of ethical values and principles in business practices. there is too much focus upon on-the-spot-accounts in the past and in current research efforts. an important area for further research is how to deal with the durability and variability of ethical values and principles in business practices in the marketplace and society. the key may be a stronger emphasis on longitudinal research efforts that may explore them over time and as contexts evolve. ethical values and principles are connected and re-connected over time and across contexts in one way or another. they have a past, a current status and a future. practical implications – the decision as to whether business practices are ethical or unethical is – relatively speaking – easy to determine from a narrow perspective, however, the decision whether business practices are ethical or unethical becomes complicated as the perspective is widened and deepened. an introduced managerial framework of epe provides a generic foundation and structure to examine the acceptability versus unacceptability of business practices. originality/value – the paper introduces a managerial framework of epe, followed by case illustrations. it addresses the impact of time on ethical values and principles in any context on the potential and eventual gaps, outcomes and consequences in business practices. the managerial framework of epe may also be used in non-business areas whenever found applicable and convenient to use.	sociology
preserving humanity in the present technological age can be a challenge for all health care workers, but perhaps particularly for staff working within an intensive care environment. this article highlights some of the potential effects of such technology on staff, patients and relatives, particularly bringing to light some of the disadvantages brought about by the use of such technology. areas considered include the role of nurses within a technological environment, patients' and relatives' reactions to technology, the potential effect on autonomy and responsibility for both patients and nurses, economic issues, and finally ethical and moral issues raised by the advent of further technology. despite many positive contributions to nursing care which arise from the use of technology, there are disadvantages attributed to technology which have only been mentioned superficially in previous literature on this subject. the question arises as to whether nurses are able to balance preserving the humanity of patients with the extensive use of technology in an intensive care environment today.	sociology
abstract in this article, i juxtapose the experiences of the working-class, young woman i was years ago and the “middle-class” academic researcher that i have become with an attempt to theorise the difficult relationship of women’s studies to the academy in the u.k. i exemplify the ways in which the issue of women’s social class is particularly problematic for women’s studies by drawing on my own personal history of being working-class in the british higher education system. i maintain that, just as my sense of integrity and autonomy as a working-class woman was continually under assault in higher education, the position of women’s studies in the academy is also about “surviving in dangerous places,” which continually jeopardises women’s studies’ aim of validating women’s experiences across social classes. drawing on my recent experience i argue that issues of co-option, insecurity, and lack of authenticity are also hallmarks of women’s studies in the late 1990s.	sociology

the cinematic universe of tsai ming-liang gives us a chance to examine how contemporary taiwanese views of personal feelings, erotica and politics interact in the new arena of cinematic representations and the biopolitics of emotion. through an analysis of the representation of the emotions in tsai's cinematography i will discuss how, in the view of the director, they are formulated and shaped by society, mechanized by a world of hypermodern consumption. in his long and complex career, emotions have of course had different nuances and functions, so that at the beginning of the 1990s, with his first trilogy, these oppressed feelings still resemble the cries of individuals, a staging of repressed but powerful agencies, and an appeal for legitimacy, understanding and sympathy. they then become more and more the stylized items of memory, fragments of imagination related to time past and to the philosophical elaboration of buddhist concepts such as piety, contempt for the human world of the passions, and reincarnation. emotions such as mourning and longing are described as ways to reach a higher, more detached philosophical point of view; a metaphysical realisation of concepts such as impermanence and reincarnation. finally, with the porno-humorous twist of the wayward cloud, emotions are completely denied, banished to the abstract world of the musical, and commercialized through the imported media of pornographic movies, where the flesh prevails with its overwhelming power over individuals and society. so, while tsai can defy (and win out against) censorship with his quasi-erotic movie, he demonstrates also - both with cinema as art and as a social construct - how sex and emotions are commercialized and become, in the same way, mere objects of consumption.	sociology
in this article, the links between neighbour relationships, gender and morality are explored from an ethnomethodological perspective. talk between disputing neighbours was analysed for instances of gender relevance and subsequent moral assessment of neighbourly activities. data from two contexts were recorded: neighbour mediation and televised disputes. the data were transcribed and subsequently analysed using membership categorization analysis, an approach that examines speakers' situated categorizations of themselves and others and tracks the emergence of cultural and moral knowledge about social life. it was found that neighbours' complaints and defences were gendered in terms of categorizations of and about women. three inter-related themes emerged in this gendering of neighbour relations. the first was that of `motherhood' and its role in warranting not just complaints about women neighbours, but also defences against complaints. second, women's relationship status was regularly invoked. the categori...	sociology

une hypothese avancee par kanter (1977) veut que les femmes cadres des grandes entreprises feraient l'objet d'attitudes plus favorables si leur nombre augmentait jusqu'a atteindre la masse critique, soit 35% de l'effectif cadre. l'hypothese a ete en partie appuyee par une etude menee aupres de cadres de la fonction publique du canada, appeles a exprimer leurs opinions en fonction des proportions reellies (9% et 20%) ou hypothetiques (35% et 50%) des femmes cadres dans leur ministere. independamment du nombre, les attitudes des femmes (n = 158) se sont averees plus favorables que celles des hommes (n = 160). cependant, l'evaluation du statut des femmes cadres, la perception de leur apport a la culture d'entreprise et les attributions sur leur compte en fonction des quatre pourcentages ne concordaient pas avec ces attitudes. les differences de sexe et le manque de coherence entre ces differentes mesures ont donne lieu a un examen plus approfondi de leurs relations les unes avec les autres, au moyen de l'analyse des structures de causalite. effectuees separement pour les deux sexes, les analyses ont revele des agencements differents des variables pour les hommes et les femmes. les attitudes de ces dernieres sont directement liees aux attributions faites sur leur compte, celles de hommes a la force numerique. la discussion suggere que la force numerique representerait une condition necessaire mais non suffisante au changement des attitudes vis-a-vis des femmes cadres. according to kanter (1977), attitudes towards female managers will likely become more favourable as their numbers increase until a critical mass of 35% is reached. this hypothesis was partially supported by the results of a study conducted in canada. the attitudes of managers of the federal public service were measured as a function of actual (9% and 20%) or fictitious (35% and 50%) proportions of female to male managers in their departments. the results indicated that attitudes towards female managers were more positive amongst women (n = 158) than amongst men (n = 160), regardless of the ratios. the respondents' evaluations of the female managers' status and of their contribution to the culture of the organization were not consistent with expressed attitudes nor were the attributions for their managerial behaviour. in order to assess the relations amongst these variables, the present study included them in a theoretical model that was tested using path analysis for each gender group. results showed that attributions are directly related with women's attitudes, while ratios are related directly with those of men. these findings suggested that an increase in the ratio of female to male managers is a necessary but insufficient condition to change attitudes towards female managers.	sociology
policy in higher education suggests that curriculum should be more responsive to economist arguments than was the case in the past. although some guidance has been given to how to develop more work-integrated curricula, little attention has been given to interactions in meetings between workplace and academic representatives in which issues of curriculum development are discussed. as such there appears to be a gap in current curriculum theory. the author suggests that such interactions may be fruitfully examined using concepts derived from studies in the sociology of science and organizational dynamics. such analyses may contribute to understanding what conditions enable productive interactions, which may be the development of hybrid objects and languages which speak to both groupings.	sociology

joining debate with alavi, leys and saul, it is argued here that to analyse the post colonial state it is necessary to know not only generally which classes influence it, but the effect these classes have on the state and society and the relative position of each. a distinction should be made between the rulingclass and the governingclass, the former having always been the metropolitan bourgeoisie, while the latter has developed from the colonial administration to the post‐colonial state with a sophisticated array of instruments to control society, including the development of a form of state monopoly capitalism. an analysis of the tanzanian state illustrates this argument. the rise to power of the new governing class, the nizers(africanders) is examined to show that the various ‘progressive’ measures undertaken by the state (nationalisation, ‘socialist’ villages) have been methods adopted by the governing class to extend its control. whatever the anti‐capitalist nature of the ideology, and the well‐meani...	sociology
this article addresses the relative absence of class-based analysis in theatre and performance studies, and suggests the reconfiguration of class as performance rather than as it is traditionally conceived as an identity predicated solely on economic stratification. it engages with the occlusion of class by the ascendancy of identity politics based on race, gender and sexuality and its attendant theoretical counterparts in deconstruction and post-structuralism, which became axiomatic as they displaced earlier methodologies to become hegemonic in the arts and humanities. the article proceeds to an assessment of the development of sociological approaches to theatre, particularly the legacy of raymond williams and pierre bourdieu. the argument concludes with the application of an approach which reconfigures class as performance to the production of declan hughes's play shiver of which dramatizes the consequences of the dot.com bubble of the late 1990s for ambitious members of the irish middle class.	sociology
this presentation is to present the findings of the completed phd research thesis ‘birthing outside the system’ which explores what motivates women to choose homebirth in high risk circumstances or to choose free birth in australia. a qualitative study design using grounded theory was used to complete this research. data was predominantly gathered using in-depth interviews with women who hadmade the choice to birth outside the system. this research found that in women were motivated togive birth outside the system because they ‘wanted the best and safest’ for themselves, their babies and their families. through the process of ‘finding a better way’, than what is currently offered in mainstream maternity services, the participants concluded that birth outside the system was the best and safest option. this presentation will explain how women came to these conclusions by explaining their perceptions of risk and safety. understanding what makes women choose birth outside the system can help midwives and policy makers understand the shortfalls of the currentmaternity care system and seek ways to make it more acceptable to birthing women. this research will also aid midwives’ understanding of the women who make these choices and change the perception that they are ‘risk-takers’.	sociology

the 1990s have seen a resurgence of interest in citizenship education in the ukand ireland. within the uk, interest in citizenship education has been fuelled by the labour government's commitment to a process of devolution and the establishment of new legislative assemblies in northern ireland, scotland and wales. this has given rise to renewed debate on issues related to nationality, identity and citizenship in each of the constituent countries of the uk. alongside this, there is a growing concern within each of these jurisdictions to understand how a sense of citizenship might be maintained within a context of increasing social, cultural and political diversity. in england in an advisory group on citizenship, under the chairmanship of professor bernard crick, issued its final report, education forcitizenship and the teaching of democracy in schools. one outcome has been the introduction of citizenship education for pupils in all schools from september for 5- to 11-year-olds and from september for 11- to 16-year-olds. the english citizenship curriculum has three main strands (social and moral responsibility; community involvement; and political literacy).the republic of ireland has had a longer involvement in the development of civic education. a pilot project between and led to the introduction of a new curriculum programme in civic, social and political education (cspe) in all secondary level schools from september 1997. cspe is a course in citizenship based on human rights and social responsibilities. it aims to develop active citizens who have a sense of belonging to the local, national, european and global communities. the course incorporates seven key concepts (democracy, rights and responsibilities, human dignity, interdependence, development, law and stewardship) and is taught through four units of study (the individual and citizenship; the community; the state; ireland and the world). in terms of its constitutional status, northern ireland is part of the uk, yet geographically it is part of the island of ireland. for historical and political reasons it has a unionist and loyalist population (predominantly protestant) that wishes to remain part of the uk and a nationalist and republican population (mainly catholic) that seeks to be part of a unified ireland. competing loyaltiesbetween british and irish identities have been a feature of the violent conflict in northern ireland for the past years. however, the belfast (good friday) agreement in april led to the establishment of new, democratic structures as part of an emerging `peace process' and guaranteed equal status to british and irish identities. this is the context in which current plans for the introduction of citizenship education in the northern ireland curriculum are taking place.this article describes recent developments in civic and citizenship education in each of these situations, highlighting the differing political contexts in which they have arisen and how these have influenced definitions of civic and citizenship education as part of new curriculum programmes.	sociology

the spate of insecurity to life and property in which many countries find themselves today is a primary concern of not only the national governments, but also the international community. the latest terrorist attack of the united states' world trade centre in new york and the pentagon in washington, d. c. on september raises an important question about the security of many countries against internal and external attacks. apart from terrorist activities, the security of many countries is also seriously threatened by a variety of reported cases of drug, currency, human trafficking and dumping of toxic wastes across national boundaries. the suspension of these criminal acts depends to a large extent on the immigration laws and other regulations of countries on the movement of persons and goods across national borders. the paper will discuss the legal (from ecowas treaty and its relevant protocols) and economic perspectives with regard to nigeria's expulsion of ecowas citizens under the buhari regime, 1983-1995. efforts will be made to examine the following questions which the author believes are of continuing interest:a) to what extent did nigeria's efforts to regulate the movement of ecowas citizens across her borders violate its commitment to ecowas treaty on movement of persons and goods?b) to what extent did nigeria accept limitation on her right to regulate same?c) in what ways did nigeria's economic security interest a major factor in controlling the movement of persons into nigeria? the purpose of the paper is three-fold. first, it seeks to take a cursory look at the conflict between the nigerian constitutional provisions and the country's legal and moral obligations to the ecowas treaty. second, it will attempt to show through a discussion of how nigeria can manage the tight-rope road of observing the provisions of the ecowas treaty without at the same time sacrificing its sovereignty. the paper concludes that the rationale for the expulsion of the so-called illegal aliens from nigeria by the buhari regime was motivated by the problem of enforcement of the provisions of ecowas treaty on movement of persons within the west african sub-region. key words: illegal, aliens, expulsion, immigration, obligation, multilateral. global journal of social sciences vol.3(1&2) 2004: 21-27	sociology

since it began in the mid-1990s, the debate surrounding the normalisation of adolescent recreational drug use has attracted considerable attention and has tended to polarise opinion within the field. in this article two of the main protagonists in the debate come together to discuss its legacy. focusing on the twin themes of continuity and change the authors begin by considering the relevance of early developments in the sociology of drug use, noting that this earlier work anticipated much that has recently been written on the subject, including the emphasis on hedonism and consumption in leisure lifestyles. from here they go on to critically reflect on the role that structure and agency have played in the normalisation debate, suggesting that the original thesis underplayed the role of structural influences in favour of a rational action model of adolescent drug use. in their more recent work, both authors have come to emphasise how drug use is shaped by an interplay between social structure and human agency. while some areas of disagreement remain, they agree that normalisation is best understood as a contingent process negotiated by distinct social groups operating in bounded situations.	sociology

narrative and dialogic modes of theorizing identity are both premised on textuality. however, theories of narrative identity tend towards unity and coherence (in accordance with the notion of narrative as constant and pre‐given), whereas the dialogic mode is more aligned with the postmodern novelistic literature (thus drawing heavily on dispersion, voice, disorder, and otherness). in accordance with the approach of mikhail bakhtin, the present study attempts to remedy the shortcomings of narrative identity by proposing change as involving shifting identities that are achieved through the transposition of utterances. only through the recognition of the undecidable, unfinalizable nature of utterance can change be conceived as being shaped and reshaped through shifting identities. such an approach reveals the interlocking relation between change and the varied texts people inhabit as they contemplate change.	sociology

this paper seeks to discuss female entrepreneurs and the challenges they face. women in the last decades have made significant progress in obtaining responsible positions in the organizations. this paradigm shift is as a result of laws governing equal opportunities and equal pay; fair employment practices; changing societal attitudes towards women in the work place; and organizations’ desire to place qualified women in managerial positions to project a favourable image. many women are becoming more educated and the idea that a woman should stay at home, baby sit, cook, go to market, take care of the children and the home is no longer current. the number of women who are gainfully employed increases per day. girl-child education is also on the increase in nigeria. this study was conducted in gwagwalada area council, f.c.t abuja. the population is about one hundred and fifty seven thousand people .the mean age is 41.59 ± 9.652. female entrepreneurs despite the problems and challenges they have faced in business are unrelenting and have continued to make meaningful contributions to their family, the area council and the nation. this paper among many issues will focus on the nature, the role and the characteristics of women entrepreneurs, the role of economic and political developments in enabling the women to start their own business, types of businesses women engaged in sources of finance and other resources, the challenges women face in business; failures and secrets to their successes, and the future challenges.	sociology
this article contributes to our understanding of the production of neoliberal policies and political culture by offering an anthropological analysis of women, poverty policy, and third way politics in ontario, canada. after tracing the history of neoliberal politics globally and in ontario, i consider two examples of women's attempts to shape poverty policy drawn from ethnographic research in the legislature. the first centers on a social assistance recipient who was unexpectedly thrust into the media spotlight, thus given a chance to speak publicly about ontario's welfare policies. the second focuses on a consciously planned challenge to policy by a coalition of feminist researchers and front‐line workers. these cases illuminate the challenges facing feminists who seek to shape third way government policy, as discussion of gender and socioeconomic inequality is actively avoided by politicians, and women's experiences of poverty and demands for action are ignored, obfuscated or re‐packaged.	sociology
"in an ad hoc committee of harvard faculty publicly redefined death as ""brain death"". what interests and issues compelled the redefinition of death, and formed the ""spirit"" of this precedent-setting policy? this paper reports on an historical study of the files of the harvard ad hoc committee, the proceedings of an international conference on ethical issues in organ transplantation, and a review of the medical literature and media in the decades preceding the redefinition of death. this analysis of the technological and professional forces involved in the redefinition of death in questions two common theses: that technological ""progress"", primarily in the areas of life support and electroencephalography, literally created brain-dead bodies and dictated their defining features (respectively), and that harvard's definition of brain death by committee constituted a net loss of autonomy for medicine. in fact, medical researchers through the 1960s disputed and negotiated many features of the brain death syndrome, and transplantation interests-perhaps more kidney than heart-played a particularly influential role in tailoring the final criteria put forth by harvard in 1968. it is also doubtful whether harvard's definition of brain death by multidisciplinary committee undermined medical privilege and autonomy. the harvard ad hoc committee may not have succeeded in establishing definitive, indisputable brain death criteria and ensuring their consistent application to all clinical cases of brain death. however, it did gain significant ground for transplant and other medical interests by (1) establishing brain death as a technical ""fact"" and the definition of brain death as an exercise for medical theorists, (2) involving non-medical ethics and humanities experts in supporting the technical redefinition of death, and, (3) successfully involving transplant surgeons in the redefinition of death and attempting (albeit unsuccessfully) not to exclude them from the actual diagnosis of death in individual cases."	sociology

the popular on the cultural traditions is structured in participation as a central focus of the social process. in this perspective, the sociological analysis must account for this in the discussion of popular and traditional. this means placing the issue of participation in socio-economic development conditions and power relations. hence, the analysis focuses on the participatory nature of popular traditions included in the economic, political and cultural relations inherent to reality. thus, in traditional folk culture it is shown the denomination of popular and traditional by the social meaning it occupies in the interpretative system of the subjects in their social relationship. this is therefore a critical perspective that is built as an immediate corollary of the theory that underlies, and both express the worldview. the possibilities of participation distinguish the popular and traditional both in its status but also as a demonstration to the development of cultural expressions. in turn, studies have contributed to the analysis of the problems of traditional folk culture and its ongoing interaction with modernity.	sociology

drawing both on his personal experience, as well as on powerful commentaries in the literature, the submission of the author here is that the principles that guide the practices of agricultural scientists are in need of fundamental transformation. the non-normative, objectivist, and reductionist conventions of 'normal' positivist agricultural science are held to be inhibiting the capacity of its practitioners to respond responsibly and adequately to a whole host of contemporary challenges of relevance to agriculture - from climate change to the use of rdna and nano-technologies. it is argued that there is a critical need for the development and adoption of a new, systemic worldview that will provide a much more appropriate conceptual and moral framework to inform the way that agricultural scientists do their work in the active pursuit of the development of 'better' more responsible and more sustainable agri-food systems.	sociology
though the direct and indirect effects of the arabic language in the middle ages on some european languages such as spanish, french, and english, there were little discussion of this fact in their histories, especially in the history of english. the little discussion of this fact is due to many various reasons. first, consideration of the orient by the europeans as their ancient domain led to many cultural conflicts between the arabs and the europeans historically. the cultural gap between the oriental and occidental person for understanding the other. second, many attempts to occupy the orient give clear illustrations that the europeans, especially the british and the french consider the orient as a place that hold their second identity and origins of their religions, judaism and christianity. during the complete colonization of the middle east in the 19th and 20th centuries make the reader figure out how important the orient for the europeans in general and for the british and the french in particular. then the descriptions of the arabs as inferior and ignorant make one understand that the practices of some arab people for polygamy and their oppression of the arab women are unacceptable in the european cultures and traditions. therefore, the arabs are classified as backward, “primitive and slave traders” (ridouani, p.2). this paper argues and investigates the cultural reasons regarding the occident’s ignorance of this fact in their history.	sociology

in the epistemological context of theory transfer and scientific exchanges, the aim of this paper is to indicate the presence of weberian categories and ideas on dependency theory formulated by fernando cardoso and enzo faletto. here we see how the construction of this paradigm was based on some issues, concepts, approaches and orientations of the weberian research program formulated by jose medina echavarria to explain latin american development. we will also consider the contexts of enunciation and reception theories, allowing us to talk about the “sociological school” that was formed i n the social planning division of ilpes in mid-sixties, crucial for understanding the history of sociology in latin america.	sociology
why post-keynesian economics, and who were its cambridge pioneers? maynard keynes, richard kahn, richard goodwin, nicholas kaldor, luigi pasinetti, joan robinson, and piero sraffa all started initially, at least in some degree, within the mainstream of their time. they all moved well and truly outside it, attempting to create either a revolutionary alternative or to rehabilitate the classical marxian tradition, in most cases in the light of the keynesian revolution. the one exception is michal kalecki, whose personal history and independent mind combined to place him virtually always outside the mainstream. this chapter, though, is not principally concerned with why and how the discontents that led them to change their minds arose. rather, its principal object is to set out the structures of their alternative approaches in order to suggest modes of thinking about theoretical and policy issues in political economy.2	sociology
this paper addresses the topic of the inclusion of roma children in education in europe through an examination of theory and practice in relation to the issues of otherness and foreignness. roma children entering school encounter a vastly different world from their home culture, with different expectations for teaching and learning, for relationships among learners, and with teachers. we address the question of whether the knowledge of these contradictions or discontinuities and knowledge of the ways in which any child from a minority group learns, is sufficient to address the issue of foreignness in educational contexts. the paper highlights the potential for interculturalism and intercultural pedagogies for engaging children from diverse cultures. cet article porte sur la question de l’inclusion des enfants roms dans le systeme educatif en europe et ce, par un examen de la theorie et la pratique par rapport aux questions de l’alterite et l’extraneite. les enfants roms qui rentrent a l’ecole sont confrontes a un monde bien different de celui de leur propre culture, ou les attentes face a l’enseignement et l’apprentissage ne sont pas les memes que celles qu’ils connaissent, ni les rapports des apprenants entre eux et entre les apprenants et les enseignants. nous nous demandons si la conscience de ces contradictions ou discontinuites et la connaissance des facons dont apprennent les enfants de groupes minoritaires suffisent pour aborder la question de l’extraneite dans des milieux educatifs. l’article souligne le potentiel de l’interculturalisme et des pedagogies interculturelles pour stimuler la participation des enfants de diverses cultures.	sociology

the university of victoria school of health information science (hinf) and the toronto hospital (tth) have formed a strategic partnership to align current information management theory with practical experience. the fourth year undergraduate course in information management and technology was redesigned to include a joint research project with tth. staff from tth were paired with groups of 2-3 students to explore current information management issues. technology such as electronic mail and conference calls enabled timely communication. final results were presented via video conference at the end of the term and jointly graded by the professor and hospital staff. over the three years, a variety of projects have been undertaken and the approach has been refined. each year offered new insight to both students and staff. findings include several key success factors: senior level support, early planning, timely communication, access to technology, and opportunity for staff and student feedback. this partnership offers strategic advantages to both organizations in innovation, mutual learning, recruiting, and partnership. next steps include expansion of the project to a regional model and seminars on current information management topics for tth staff.	sociology
this article accounts for the way proportionality principles have been executed in colombia for the control of constitutionality of the states of emergency, through the evaluation of six (6) special cases from four (4) of them related to internal states of exception and two (2) of them related to social emergency. a qualitative methodology was used to describe the way the constitutional court was applying the proportionality principle to analyze such exceptions, accounting for an analysis matrix that describes the key points of such principle, to wit: a) the existence of a special crisis and not of a structural damage to the states of exception; b) not suspension of human rights or basic freedom of people over which measures are imposed; c) not interruption of the normal operation of the government branches; d) the exercise of powers exclusively to effectively face abnormalities; the strict relationship between cause and abnormality and, in this sense, the direction of decrees only and exclusively to resolve the causes that give origin to the state of exception; e) the length defined for the states of exception (cifuentes, 2002) to conclude that the constitutional court, while applying the proportionality principle, has failed to make an exhaustive judgment of the requirements incorporated; in this way, it has allowed a perpetuation of the executive power and a government with no separation of powers.	sociology
background: like other immigrants, iranians face difficulties using sexual and reproductive health services in australia. expectations may be affected by experiences of population control services in iran. methods: fifty-one iranian women in sydney (new south wales) participated in individual interviews and focus groups in 2003- 2004. recorded interviews were transcribed and translated into english and subjected to thematic and narrative analysis. results: concepts of sexual health among respondents centred on reproductive gynaecology: pregnancy, contraception and menopause. issues around relationships or sexual pleasure or pain were not thought of as being issues of 'sexual health'. discussion: communication with sexual health caregivers is hampered by the euphemistic, vague and symbolically loaded terminology used by the women in their own language, and their lack of knowledge of english and medical terms. they are reluctant to use interpreters and lack faith in their right to confidentiality. practical suggestions for providing appropriate clinical care include the use of communication aids, approaching the topic obliquely and interviewing the woman's husband where appropriate.

this paper aims to trace the descent of ‘enthusiasm’ in the twentieth century russian cultural history as well as understand the totalitarianism under the stalinist authority and its consequences in the late twentieth century. in doing so, we started by categorizing the concept of ‘enthusiasm’ into the ‘earth-grounded type’ and the ‘authority-oriented type’.the mainstream symbolist movement in the early twentieth century russian culture obtained an eschatological tendency under the influence of sorov'yov's school. later, ivanov opened up a way to the primitivist movement by recognizing the role of ‘symbol’ within the dionysian integration. such is an example of the ‘grounded’ type of enthusiasm.nourishing on such enthusiasm, the russian avant-garde art movement blossomed. after the russian revolution, the russian avant-garde art, through artist such as mayakovsky and meierhold, realised the enthusiasm in both directions. on the other hand, there were artists such as eisenstein who attempted to integrate to the stalinist authority by deploying an anthoropological imagination, even though tending towards the ‘earth-grounded’ enthusiasm.the era of the ‘thaw’ was also the era in which the spirit of integration (sobornost') originated in the russian orthodox tradition flourished. but since stalin's death the centripetal force of enthusiasm was lost. the process of anti-stalinism failed to realise the regression towards world history, and caused the new era of closure called ‘the post-utopean era’. the characteristic of ‘informal culture’ which existed between the ‘thaw’ and the breshnev era is understood as the movement attempting to overcome the stalinist influence through intense sophistication of the concept of ‘distance’.even though the soviet socialist declined through the influence of high-tech revolution in the western europe, the recent postmodernists devise russian history with the concept of ‘emptiness (pustota) ’, identifying russia as the state of simulation without reference. such postmodernists attempt to harmonize with the totalitarianism, but at the same time seek for a way to overcome stalinism as they skillfully attempt to secretly innovate the rigid dichotomous framework.	sociology

abstractthe [wall/barrier/fence] built by israel near the green line has produced a new object around which political actors, especially those engaged in contentious politics around the israeli/palestinian conflict, can use to focus and shape their language and actions. using the notion of discursive fields, this paper examines the use of the three terms wall, fence, and barrier among social movement actors from israel, palestine, and elsewhere to describe the object, arguing that the difference between wall-discourse and fence-discourse marks out separate discursive faces that embody different sets of assumptions about the conflict, relevant actors, and normative priorities. it also argues that, while barrier-discourse tries to stake out a ground outside this binary, its reception by those engaged in other discourses negates the attempt.	sociology
complex systems, issues, and problems call for a careful analysis of choices and decisions, and how these decisions affect multiple stakeholders in the present and the long term. generic leadership characteristics and competencies such as cognitive ability, emotional intelligence, and cultural intelligence are not sufficient in providing effective leadership in a complex, globalized world. the focus of this chapter is to highlight and describe the concept of wisdom as an essential foundation of leadership in resolving today’s challenges. in the recent past, scholars have identified wisdom as the missing dimension in providing effective leadership. wisdom involves making informed decisions, bearing in mind short-term and long-term consequences of decisions to multiple stakeholders. mckenna and rooney1 have articulated the concept visioning and a perspective-taking capacity that incorporates long-range goals. this perspective may at times be at odds with notions of leadership effectiveness that are based on objective measurements and tangible benefits. wisdom involves transcending above a narrow focus of decisions to higher ideals of improving and sustaining the human condition, resources, and the environment. wisdom also involves understanding complex systems by tapping into different gestalts of knowledge to distill relevant issues into actions, and the ability to unite different interest parties into a winning coalition. our focus is on the concept of wisdom and how it can be applied in dealing with these challenges. we proceed by describing the contextual globalized world, our understanding of wisdom, selected relevant literature, the need for a wise leader, and profiles of wise leaders.	sociology
over the past few decades, researchers, educators, and policymakers have become increasingly concerned about preparing future generations for life in the rapidly changing global society; thus, interest in the global dimension of school curricula has been growing. however, as tension often exists between this global dimension and national education, infusing the former into the latter is not an easy task. although some countries claim their national curriculum has a global dimension, and many global educators emphasize the relevance of global education in all curriculum areas, little empirical evidence supports such claims. to bridge this gap, the extent to which school textbooks reflect a global dimension must be explored. therefore, this study conducted a content analysis of elementary school textbooks in taiwan to examine the scope of their global dimension. we found that around % of the textbooks’ content was related to the global dimension, the majority of which was in the learning areas of social studies and integrative activities. the most evident global education concepts were ecological sustainability and world peace, whereas human rights and social justice were underrepresented. the ideal of linking the global dimension with all aspects of education and all curriculum areas remains a challenge. we provide suggestions for teachers, educational authorities, and textbook publishers and authors regarding revisions to current textbooks to enhance the global dimension.	sociology

throughout the colonial world, sex, sexuality and intimacy were topics of intense scrutiny.1 in colonial spaces sexual control was, according to ann laura stoler, a method in which colonial authorities could regulate not only the lives of the europeans within colonial spaces, but also the lives of indigenous peoples.2 missionaries were also very concerned with the sexuality and sexual practices of the people amongst whom they worked, and often saw the female sexuality of indigenous peoples as being in need of controlling and according to christian norms. missionaries had long expected their converts to conform to christian moral codes relating to sex and sexuality. the historian gorden sayre has asserted in the context of seventeenth century northern america that 'missionaries took the well-defined christian separation between the chaste and the unchaste and used it as an analogy for the distinction between the converted and unconverted around their mission.'3 such sentiments seeped into the nineteenth century in all corners of the globe. chastity was seen as a sign of a docile and regenerate people, and conversely, promiscuous behaviour was a sign of rebellion and a lack of respect for authority and christian norms. natasha erlank has argued that missionaries in the 1840s in xhosaland, south africa lacked methods of enforcing upon the converts their preferred sexual codes and therefore used 'the control of spiritual resources to punish converts.'4 such control included refusal of baptism, excommunication, and suspension from positions of moral authority. this paper argues that not only exclusion from but also inclusion within christian practices served as forms of punishment for indigenous people seen to be at odds with the moral practices and sexual codes expected on a mission station. in particular, this paper contends that the arranged marriages of indigenous females on moravian mission stations in the colony of victoria in the mid-nineteenth century was undertaken by the missionary in charge in order to control the sexuality of these women.	sociology

this paper is a perspective on the strengths and weaknesses of community development research offered to health promoters by a community development insider. the author provides her rationale for the opinion that no research paradigm other than the qualitative one satisfies the naturalistic context of either community development or health promotion, including inquiry into concepts such as community health, community wellbeing, community competence and community self-reliance. attention is drawn to key aspects of the community development process with relevance to health promoters which are largely undertheorized, including clarity about the central issue of the nature of the interaction among learning, action and change. finally, the paper specifies three implications of the naturalistic paradigm for either research or practice. these include academic prejudice against qualitative research from some quarters, the limitations of all research paradigms for some questions, and essential uncertainties of naturalistic inquiry.	sociology

this article seeks to review the recent incarnation of a long-standing engagement in international political economy (ipe) and critical theory between open marxist perspectives (omps) and their critics. the article aims to identify the enduring relevance of this debate in order to think about the possibility and future of critical social inquiry in our time constructively. it criticises elements on both sides of the debate that no longer serve but rather hinder achieving this objective. we argue that the recent criticisms make a number of important constructive points that could help enhance the explanatory power of omps yet still portray the latter uncharitably. we propose to take the emphasis on openness in omps seriously as a scholarly and political orientation without immersing the debate with the charges of reductionism, instrumentalism, determinism and functionalism which are frequently raised by various versions of marxism against one another—often to little avail.	sociology

language is a very important tool in literature, as literature cannot be studied without language, be it written or spoken. language is used differently by different writers; therefore, it is important to analyse how language is used to create an effect and as such, bring out meaning. stylistics is the study of text from it literary and linguistics perspective. it studies the feature and functions of both spoken and written texts ‒ it is a practical way of understanding the meaning of a given text. writers have diverse ways of communicating idea, and using literary and linguistic categories to communicate ideas in a text is simply doing a stylistic analysis of the text. the purpose of this paper is to analyse the poems, “i know why the caged bird sings” and “equality” by maya angelou, so as to know how language brings out the stylistic effects of a writer, and contributes in generating meaning. the stylistics tool explore in this study are: graphology, syntax, semantics, lexico-semantics, phonology, morphology, foregrounding, contrast, imagery, personification, metaphor, simile etc. this study has as findings that language is the essential part of any work of arts, and the achievement of any work centers on how the artist uses language to communicate meaning.	sociology

the main purpose of this paper is to explore the possibility of articulating political discourse theory (pdt) together with organizational studies (os), while using the opportunity to introduce pdt to those os scholars who have not yet come across it. the bulk of this paper introduces the main concepts of pdt, discussing how they have been applied to concrete, empirical studies of resistance movements. in recent years, pdt has been increasingly appropriated by os scholars to problematize and analyze resistances and other forms of social antagonisms within organizational settings, taking the relational and contingent aspects of struggles into consideration. while the paper supports the idea of a joint articulation of pdt and os, it raises a number of critical questions of how pdt concepts have been empirically used to explain the organization of resistance movements. the paper sets out a research agenda for how both pdt and os can together contribute to our understanding of new, emerging organizational forms of resistance movements.	sociology

emergency powers are as old as constitutionalism, reflecting fundamental tensions in the rule of law that pervade many aspects of political life. hence, exploring philosophical and institutional aspects of emergencies can lead to broader conclusions about law and individual power. by engaging not just emergency powers but aspects of administrative law with a similar structure, david dyzenhaus concludes that all branches of government ought to rule in a ‘spirit of legality’ according to principles underlying the rule of law. this aspirational conception of the rule of law raises important questions about the relationship between empirical and normative enquiry. related questions arise in oren gross and fionnuala ni aolain's new book. these authors argue that existing emergency law rests on an empirical mistake with serious normative consequences. if emergencies lack discrete beginnings and endings, which institutional arrangements minimize these consequences? both books leave critical questions in their wa...	sociology
"anchored in insights from my evolving research in mexico and the united states, this article engages the literature on democratic citizenship education and proposes a potentially unifying research program for the anthropology of education. i urge anthropologists of education to address questions of political order and to bring democracy and citizenship toward the center of our concerns. just as anthropology has much to contribute to the challenges of citizenship education around the world, a reinvigorated cross-cultural comparison can enrich our working theories of democracy and enliven our contributions to the democratization of education in the united states. [citizenship, identity, democracy, public anthropology, mexico and the united states] i begin this article with the observation of an irony that will be central to it. over the last years, dominant discourses of economic competitiveness, academic basics, and accountability have driven national education policy in the united states and several other liberal democracies. while embracing the rhetoric of democracy, this trend has actually crowded out policies and practices oriented toward civic education for democratic citizenship. in the united states, the movement toward privatization has shrunk the public sphere and occluded practices of democratic education rooted in traditions as diverse as jeffersonian republicanism, horace mann's common school, horace kallen's cultural pluralism, deweyan participatory democracy, or martin luther king, jr.'s, civic empowerment. to be sure, countermovements such as the coalition of essential schools or the national school reform faculty at the national level, as well as local practices such as service learning and common school uniforms, have kept these democratic educational traditions alive. still, they swim presently against a very strong current. now more than ever, our schools overwhelmingly seek to create the economically competent or adaptable worker, not the democratic or intercultural citizen. the practical consequence of such trends has been the eclipse of subjects and teaching methods that impart the skills and dispositions of democratic citizenship, by the subjects and teaching methods suited for imparting standardized academic knowledge. much of the latter is justified by a discourse in favor of so-called ""lifelong learning""-arguably a euphemism to train flexible labor for capital. over these same years, meanwhile, there has been an explosion of interest in democratic citizenship and civic education around the world (stevick and levinson forthcoming). this appears to be one of the many paradoxes of globalization: as states everywhere generally shrink or background their political-economic functions,"	sociology

following public debate on the dissonance between tribal traditions of self- governance and modern formal institutions in december parliament extended the panchayat act to the areas covered by schedule v of the constitution. in many parts of india this has facilitated tribal womens legal right to participate in nrm. this paper describes the particular situation in northeastern india which is a region of great biogeographic and strategic significance. in the northeast existing customary practices (backed by special constitutional arrangements or the provisions of schedule vi) continue to deny tribal women ownership and significant control over local resources. with particular reference to arunachal pradesh and mizoram the paper argues for a reappraisal by tribal women and men of the sharply gender-biased customary practices and constitutional provisions in order to draw out womens power and strengthen their capacity to shape local resource management.

"if there is a space that permits close-up observation of the transformation of the contemporary family with respect to the way parents treat their children (and how their children treat them), we could perhaps direct our attention to the adolescents' bedroom. this is not to say that the private space was any less relevant in the past (from the 1960's onwards young people adopted virginia woolf's old slogan a room of my own). what has happened in the last decade is that this territory of femininity has been juvenilized, affecting all social groups, as a bastion and an emergent laboratory of juvenile microculture, which, besides the public space, finds its emblem in the real and virtual contacts that are made from this ""room of one's own"". this article presents a first outline of the results of an ethnographic study of this question, although, before setting it out, we propose a theoretical model of the changes in parent-children relations (what we call the ""generational clock"") and a general panorama (based on recent statistical data) of the relation of young people with digital culture, one of the foundations of bedroom cultures."	sociology
the author takes note of the relative unpopularity of pedagogical and in‐service training for university teachers, particularly in the german‐speaking university world, and asks himself why this is the case. the reason, he suggests, has to do with the traditional view that what counts in universities is research, teaching being a secondary preoccupation of the teaching staff. yet, public opinion as well as selected european higher education institutions and administrations have mounted efforts to make pedagogical training a standard part of the required qualifications of university teaching staff members. following a survey of european efforts, particularly in the united kingdom and in germany, to interest university teachers in university‐level pedagogy, the author presents what a polling of teachers and students in germany consider to be good teaching practices. he urges all teaching staff members to adopt these practices.	sociology
although there are calls for more reflection on the practice of arts management (devereaux 2009), there is a widely shared and rarely challenged certainty about the practice itself. arts managers are perceived as financial caretakers in the realm of the arts and as dutiful, but artistically uninvolved, enablers of artists and the arts. this article argues that this account gives only a vague notion of what arts managers actually do and that it misapprehends their functions and practices in several ways. the following is an empirical and sociological attempt toward a more accurate perception of arts managers. first, it identifies essential features of the common view of arts managers held by members of the academic discipline itself, by practitioners of arts management, and by sociological researchers of the topic. second, it presents a possible research design, arguing that a qualitative empirical approach combined with an analytic perspective focusing on the sociological concept of functional differentia...	sociology

menstrual taboos, i argue, can be understood only in relation to other ritual restrictions, ones observed by men as well as women, and have significant implications for our understanding of female ritual roles. gender imagery in tuareg menstrual ritual and cosmology is used as a metaphor for relations between participants in wider socioeconomic contexts, and it forms a symbolic medium of conflict and ambiguity for tuareg men and women. in this article, ritual restrictions are seen as an idiom through which struggles and paradoxes are presented and individual responses to predicaments are encoded. they constitute efforts to control descent and to protect the statuses of both men and women; they represent a reflection on the subject of the differentiation of noble and nomadic values from other, competing values in tuareg society. the bases of this differentiation do not fall into rigid polarities between male and female, “official” and “unofficial” religion. ritual restrictions on women serve not to protect islam or tuareg men but to preserve the identity and lifestyle of the traditional tuareg nobility.

abstract weber's concept of charisma has received diverse and contradictory interpretations. the essay argues that this diversity is caused less by inadequate readings of weber than by inconsistencies in weber's own conceptualization. weber introduced his concept of charisma in two different contexts: his political sociology and his sociology of religion. in his political sociology he formulates the ideal type of charismatic authority informed by r. sohm. in his sociology of religion weber connects it with the anthropological debate of the turn of the century on magic and religion, especially the debate on pre-animism initiated by r. r. marett, and uses it as an alternative for concepts like mana or orenda. both conceptualizations of charisma are located on quite different levels of abstraction, which weber has not sufficiently clarified and systematized. this leads to inconsistencies, contradictions, and overgeneralizations. especially problematic is his claim of a supposedly anti-traditionalist or even ...	sociology

"abstract it is well known that james mark baldwin held a position at the university of toronto when he assisted in the formation of the american psychological association in but the proceedings of the preliminary organizational meeting of the apa, held in july of that year, include the name of a second torontonian as well, that ofj.g. hume. the present paper outlines the career of james gibson hume, who studied with g. stanley hall, william james, and hugo munsterberg, and who headed the philosophy department at the university of toronto for over years. he was by no means a great or influential philosopher or psychologist, but the study of his life gives some insight into what a more common philosopher-psychologist was doing and thinking during the time that hall, james, munsterberg, and others were revolutionizing both disciplines. a look at the first item of the august issue of science reveals a report of the preliminary organizational meeting of the american psychological association (apa), held some six weeks earlier, on july at clark university. clark university president g. stanley hall had sent out invitations to an unknown number of psychologists, psychiatrists, and philosophers of mind, of whom agreed to join the fledgling organization. the list includes many of the luminaries of the discipline at that time. in addition to hall, there were a number of figures who had founded the first generation of experimental psychological laboratories in the u.s.: william james from harvard, james mckeen cattell of columbia, and frank angell, who has just moved from cornell to stanford. there were also joseph jastrow of wisconsin, e.c. sanford, who had moved with hall from hopkins to clark, and e.w. scripture of yale. not all of the original apa members were founders of laboratories - there were some philosophers as well, such as harvard's josiah royce, and john dewey, then of michigan - but the organization was intended by hall to be primarily a society of and for the ""new breed"" of scientific psychologists (see sokal, 1992). as is well known to canadian historians of psychology, another member of this select group was james mark baldwin, who had just established the first permanent experimental psychology lab in the british empire at the university of toronto. baldwin was an important member of the new organization, being immediately appointed to the first council of the apa, a body that would oversee its early affairs. baldwin was in the process of becoming a highly influential psychologist - he had just published the second volume of his textbook (baldwin, 1891a), and would return to princeton the following year. soon thereafter he would cofound psychological review (with cattell), and later psychological bulletin, among other achievements. but baldwin was not the only torontonian on the list. in addition there was j.g. hume, also of toronto. we learn nothing else of hume in the minutes of that preliminary meeting, and it seems unlikely, though not impossible, that he actually traveled all the way to massachusetts to attended this short conference. (the list of names in the minutes identifies not just attendees, but ""original members who were either present at this meeting or sent letters of approval and accepted membership,"" p. italics added.) however, by counting the number of apa members at the time of the first annual meeting, which was held six months later, in december at the university of pennsylvania -- namely, - and looking at the list of those who were absent, which is included in the proceedings of that meeting, we can be nearly certain that hume was in attendance, though he did not participate either as a presenter or discussant. the proceedings of the second annual meeting at columbia university in december tell us that hume was not in attendance, but at the third annual meeting, held in december at princeton (cohosted by baldwin, who had since left toronto to take up a chair at his alma mater), hume was scheduled to give a paper on the state of psychological teaching and research at toronto. …"	sociology

this study traces the interaction of religion and the labor movement in philadelphia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. exploring the ways that protestantism mediated between the dominant and working-class versions of american society, ken fones-wolf examines the ambiguity of christianity as a social force in class conflict. using philadelphia as a case study, he shows that aspects of working-class culture and trade union activism were rooted in protestantism and that religious feeling was a significant factor of working-class life. while religious values complemented a broad spectrum of political and class positions and helped people adjust to social change, christianity itself was a dynamic force that adapted to emerging ideas of social responsibility and the jarring disjunctions between old beliefs and new realities. author note: ken fones-wolf heads the archives and teaches labor history at the university of massachusetts at amherst. he was formerly manuscripts curator at the urban archives center of temple university.	sociology

"recent trends in popular culture suggest an emerging discourse of professional masculinity in crisis. this essay examines two illustrative films, fight club and in the company of men, whose characters bemoan the impending demise of the masculine businessman. to revive him, they (re)turn to what we call a ""civilized/primitive"" masculinity, embodied by the hardened white man who finds healing in wounds. this subjectivity shrouds the race and class hierarchy on which it rests by overtly appealing to gender division. the current discourse of dominant men in crisis bears remarkable resemblance to historical narratives of masculinity in decline. ultimately, we argue that this pattern reveals chronic conflicts embedded in particular performances of masculinity and thus, potential vulnerabilities in patriarchal capitalism."	sociology
families caring for dependent children need time, income and services in order to carry out the important function of raising children, an essential social and economic activity that ensures survival and wellbeing of the society. this article focuses on income, and reports on a piece of original socio-demographic research that used unpublished australian bureau of statistics (abs) data to explore the incomes of australian women and men in different family circumstances. the research shows that couple family men have markedly higher incomes than couple family women, single fathers and single mothers. we need social policy that takes account of diversity of family forms; makes it possible for all families raising children to gather together adequate income; encourages gender equity; and acknowledges the raising of children as activity that benefits the whole community. along with these requirements, social policy must recognise that caring for children takes time, and that the demands of children change over the lifecourse. the lifecourse considerations include the high demands on parental time in the early years; and recognition of change in roles and circumstances over time.	sociology

england's education acts in the late nineteenth century made school free and mandatory for all children, filling schools with more and younger students. visual teaching methods such as blackboard drawing were used to catch young students’ eyes and engage their interest. at the same time, there was high public engagement with natural history and popular science lectures, which built the perception of science as accessible, interesting and useful for people of all social classes. this “science for all” trend along with the new universal education paved the way for nature study, a new school subject based on experiential learning through observation of plants and animals, similar to the popular nineteenth-century pedagogy of object lessons. the many manuals about nature study that were published for teachers in england in the early twentieth century reveal the content, pedagogy, and portrayal of science communicated to young students. analysis of one manual, nature teaching on the blackboard (1910), sheds li...	sociology

"in spite of the political pressures and continual displacement that radically shaped the course of his life (or, perhaps, because of them), vladimir nabokov was an individual for whom humor was a dauy necessity. he also developed a reputation for being a quick wit. alfred appel records an encounter involving nabokov's humor that occurred during a conversation about whether vietnam demonstrations were affecting appel's classes at northwestern:""my classroom problems are not political,"" i continued. i told him about a nun who sat in the back row of one of my lecture courses, and who one day complained after class that a couple near her were always spooning. ""sister,"" i had said, ""in these troubled times we should be grateful if that's all they were doing""; and i related this to nabokov rather smugly, proud of what i deemed to be my quick wit. ""ohhh,"" moaned nabokov, mourning my lost opportunity, clapping his hand to his head in mock anguish, ""you should have said, 'sister, be grateful that they were not forking.'"" (appel 21)although the humor of nabokov's joke is the treasure of this exchange, its most interesting aspect is the relationship between appel's attempt at wit and nabokov's. appel's joke is the product of his gentle derision of the nun's high ideal of sexual morality in a culture in which standards have fallen considerably, while nabokov's exploits a linguistic ambiguity in the term ""spoon ing"" for comic effect.the circumstance that most fully explains the difference between these two jokes is the perspective of their tellers on the culture they are joking about. appel's reference to loosening standards of sexual morality reflects his approach to the culture from the perspective of an insider. as a lifelong participant in american culture, he possesses the understanding to pass such a judgment. conversely, nabokov's play on language derives from his perspective as an outsider, both to american culture and, more importandy, to american idiom. for appel and, presumably, many americans who grew up with the term, ""spooning"" has largely become separated from its origin as a metaphor. as a result of common usage, the term is more likely to be directly associated with feellngs of tenderness, emotional closeness, and physical intimacy than the mental image of congruent silverware. however, for an outsider like nabokov who does not possess these cultural associations, the ambiguity of the metaphor rings primary, allowing him access to the double entendre in the literal world of the silverware metaphor that most cultural insiders would be unhkely to recognize in the context of everyday speech.1nabokov's comic exilenabokov's separation from his homeland has been recognized by scholars as part of a broader trend within the canon of twentieth-century literature. noting ""the emergence of linguistic pluralism or 'unhousedness' in certain great writers,"" george steiner calls ""the literature of exile . . . perhaps the main impulse of current literature,"" a genre that he dubs 'extraterritorial' (1971, viu).2 edward said makes the even broader claim that ""[mjodern western culture is in large part the work of exiles, emigres, refugees"" (2000, 173). every critical account of nabokov's relationship to exile and, indeed, all broader theoretical approaches to ""extraterritorial"" literature more generally have one thing in common: they approach separation from the homeland as a topic of deep seriousness. however, a list of the most canonical of extraterritorial authors is also a who's who of twentieth-century high literary humor. susan elizabeth sweeney makes the argument that ""writers like nabokov, borges, beckett, and joyce simply do not fit the standard linguistic, cultural, and generic compartments of the literary canon and cannot be fully understood in those terms"" (1994, 334). because they ""write for the world, instead of for one particular culture"" (1984, 28), sweeney argues that these writers' transcendence of culturally specific criteria of canonicity coincides with their transcendence of any national literature. …"	sociology

discontent with public education has been on the rise in recent years, as parents complain that their children are not being taught the basics, that they are not pushed to excel, and that their classrooms are too chaotic to encourage any real learning. the public has begun to reject school bond levies with regularity, frustrated by what it perceives to be mounting education costs unaccompanied by increased achievement or accountability. coulson explores the educational problems facing parents and shows how these problems can best be addressed. he begins with a discussion of what people want from their school systems, tracing their views of the kinds of knowledge, skills, and values education should impart, and their concerns over discipline, drugs, and violence in public schools. using this survey of goals and attitudes as a guide, coulson sets out to compare the school systems of civilizations both ancient and modern, seeking to determine which systems successfully educated generations past and which did not. his historical study ranges from classical greece and ancient rome, through the islamic world of the middle ages, to nineteenth-century england and modern america. drawing on the historical evidence of how these various systems operated, coulson concludes that free educational markets have consistently done a better job of serving the public's needs than state-run school systems have. he sets out a blueprint for competitive, free-market educational reform that would make schools more flexible, more innovative, and more responsive to the needs of parents and students. he describes how education for low-income children might be funded under a market system, and how the transition from monopolistic public education to market education might be achieved. coulson's market education touches on a wide range of issues, including declines in academic achievement, minority education, the role of public school teachers, and mismanagement and corruption in educational bureaucracies. coulson examines alternative reform proposals from vouchers and charter schools to national standards for school curricula. this timely and engaging book will appeal to parents, educators, and others concerned with the quality and cost of schooling, and will serve as an excellent resource in college courses on the economics and history of education.	sociology
academic interest in corporate social responsibility (csr) can be traced back to the 1930s. since then an impressive body of empirical data and theory-building has been amassed, mainly located in the fields of management studies and business ethics. one of the most noteworthy recent conceptual contributions to the scholarship is midttun’s (corporate governance 5(3):159–174, 2005) csr-oriented embedded relational model of societal governance. it re-conceptualises the relationships between the state, business, and civil society. other scholars (in albareda et al. corporate governance 6(4):386–400, 2006; business ethics: a european review 17(4):347–363, 2008; lozano et al., governments and corporate social responsibility, 2008) have recently successfully used the model as the basis for their analytical framework for researching csr activities in a large number of western european countries. while this research offers valuable insights into how csr is operationalised, it also suffers from a number of significant limitations. to develop a stronger analytical framework with which to explore csr, this article draws more deeply on political science literature concerned with governance and public policy analysis. this represents the main purpose of this article. in addition, this article also addresses a second and more modest aim: to reflect on the ways in which relational governance-inspired frameworks could be adapted and applied to politico-economic systems where state-industry-third sector relations differ from those found in north america and western europe. both lines of argument are illustrated using vignettes from a case study of the evenkia hydro-electric station building project in the russian federation.	sociology

this article aims to examine the dialectic interface between the canadian mi’kmaq traditions and catholicism, the latter brought into their territory by french missionaries as early as the beginning of the 17th century. although today there have been critical voices raised by some mi’kmaq against the catholic church, which they see as a symbol for colonial repression, most mi’kmaq today belong to the catholic congregation. but to fully understand the mi’kmaq relation to catholicism we have to consider different contexts where colonial history and contemporary reserve life play important roles for its present form. mi’kmaq have created their history within a colonial frame, but they have not passively adopted colonial power structures into their communities. instead they have interpreted the new conditions and acted in ways in which they have built models both of the world and for the world. in this building of new models and practices, rituals for the mi’kmaq have played a decisive role when molding their way of being in the canadian society.

due to the proliferation of touch screen devices, both technical and non-technical users are increasingly using these devices including the older adults. interaction with input devices while on the go is increasing and has become a common habit of people nowadays. in fact, at times it might also be a need for different people of different age groups. common sense leads to believe that performing tasks that require high mental workload such as text input in walking state, can prove fatal as the users visual attention gets split between the environment and the device. situational impairment can happen because of environmental, attentional and physical factors at various times while the user is operating the device. previous studies have measured the negative impact of mobility on text input performance of young adults, expert users on touch screen devices of different sizes. in this paper, we present the research studies done on text input in mobility conditions and methods used for input method evaluation.	sociology

what is the relationship between our conception of humans as producers or creators; as consumers of taste and pleasure; and as creators of value? combining cultural history, economics, and literary criticism, regenia gagnier's new work traces the parallel development of economic and aesthetic theory, offering a shrewd reading of humans as workers and wanters, born of labor and desire. the insatiability of human wants begins during a key transitional moment in aesthetic and economic theory, when both disciplines underwent a turn from production to consumption models. in economics, an emphasis on the theory of value and the social relations between land, labor, and capital gave way to more individualistic models of consumerism. similarly, in aesthetics, theories of artistic production or creativity soon bowed to models of taste, pleasure, and reception. using these developments as a point of departure, gagnier deftly traces the shift in western thought from models of production to consumption. from its exploration of early market logic and kantian thought to its look at the aestheticization of homelessness and our own market boom, the insatiability of human wants invites us to contemplate alternative interpretations of economics, aesthetics, and history itself.	sociology
abstractthe purpose of this paper is to discuss the theoretical genealogy and main uses of heritage in actually existing communist countries. this is performed by carrying out a critical review of eleazar aleksandrovic baller’s communism and cultural heritage, (1984, progress, moscow). the analysis of baller’s work reveals that the logics of heritage in communist countries differed in various ways from capitalist countries, mainly because of the almost total state control over the heritage apparatus and the subordination of heritage policies to marxist–leninist ideology. heritage was fundamental in dealing with the problem of change and continuity with the traditions, narratives and identities of previous society, and in the process of transforming citizens into ‘new men’ through the cultural revolution and the inculcation of ideology through museums and monuments.	sociology
since ancient times writings on government and leadership show concern for values and virtues of rulers and administrators. a large part of the received texts in political philosophy and ethics deals with remedies against certain human traits and temptations that are understood to undermine rule in the public interest or the common good. plato, cicero, augustine and many others depicted individuals in powerful positions as inclined to use public powers for their own benefit (or that of their kin and associates), or as tempted to act without proper evaluation of cases at hand, or as likening to identify the continuance of their ruling position with the common good, etc. in their treatises these philosophers pointed out certain laws, or dominant orientations or other societal characteristics that did not properly remedy such temptations, but in fact stimulated them. for this reason, plato and the others argued for specific arrangements — sometimes involving a complete societal revolution — supporting the proper development and support of public values and virtues.	sociology
purpose – the purpose of this paper is to investigate factors affecting attitudes toward social-local-mobile (solomo) advertising from the perspective of social capital. design/methodology/approach – there were respondents filling out the survey instrument. the research model in this study is tested using spss software. findings – the results show that structural, relational, and cognitive dimensions of social capital have impacts on consumer attitudes toward solomo advertising. originality/value – it contributes to the literature by advancing our knowledge about determinants of effective solomo advertising from the perspective of social capital. it also provides constructs that constitute the three dimensions in advertising. the author expands the understanding of the social relations under the context of business to consumer by adding substantial nuances to the understanding of the role of social capital in advertising. finally, this study provides practical suggestions.	sociology

the article explicates the significance of m. weber’s works for understanding of calling as an important world view idea of the european culture. the author observes weber’s analysis of forming of the notion of calling in the times of ancient egypt state and judaic captivity as well as in the old testament and its interpretations by m. luther. particularly significant for the understanding of social processes during the reformation in europe and then in america became weber’s analysis of the transformation of the religious meaning of calling as “task” and “mission” of a man in the world into the motivation for a practical professional activity. the study shows the ways of implementation of weber’s theory of social action and political leadership within the concept of calling. the internal collision of the experience of calling is explicated by the examples of charismatic leadership, responsibility of a politician and ethos of a scientist. combination of affective motivation, value and target oriented rationality in the calling forms the problem for a decision, although this complexity is a driving force of the realization of calling by a person. the philosophical and theological substratum of the weber’s concept of calling is his looking for the integration of temporal and eternal dimensions in human existence. calling as an idea of postreformational european culture serves for finding and realization of the meaning of personal life as well as for legitimation of social action. especially this idea grounds the possibility and necessity of conciliation of the ethics of conviction and the ethics of responsibility in individual as well as in social existence and morality.	sociology

"the paper discusses rural to urban migration in modern norway from a class perspective, focusing on to what extent actors in different social classes have distinct migration patterns. the analysis is based on norwegian census data from the period between 1960-90 (ten-yearly), and traces the social (e.g. education, occupation, and income) and geographic mobility of all norwegians born in 1955. data about their parents' social background are also employed. the number of cases is approximately 70,000. theoretically the paper is based on a bourdieuian perspective. the point of departure is a hypothesis that young people from better-off rural families are the most likely ones to leave the countryside in favour of a more urban life, basically due to education motives. this is sought explained by employing bourdieu's concepts of economic and cultural capital, and his claim that the objective class structures, which reflects unequal access to and composition of to these forms of capital, should be related to dif-ferences in the structures of subjective life-style (la distinction, bourdieu 1979). in this way migration decisions may be understood as results of class structured ""lifestyle choices""."	sociology

russian abstract: превращение аспирантуры в третью ступень высшего образования актуализирует вопросы организационного и методического обеспечения учебного процесса подготовки кадров высшей квалификации. введение в действие с 01.09.2015 большинства фгосов по третьему уровню высшего образования и необходимость выдачи диплома об окончании аспирантуры требует кардинальной перестройки существующих учебных планов и образовательных программ, разработки новых форм итоговой аттестации. в то же время остается открытым вопрос о разграничении второго (магистратура) и третьего (аспирантура) уровней высшего образования. с точки зрения авторов статьи, это разграничение носит не формальный, а содержательный характер, и связано с различием в задачах, которые должны решаться на каждом из этих уровней. не существует просто последовательной смены одного уровня другим; нельзя говорить о том, что аспирантура — это углубленная магистратура. во многом эти уровни находятся не в последовательной, а в параллельной связи. магистры экономики должны уметь управлять экономическими процессами, а «исследователи. преподаватели-исследователи» по направлению «экономика» — исследовать фундаментальные и прикладные проблемы, существующие в разных областях экономики. это означает, что человек, успешно закончивший магистратуру, не становится автоматически хорошим исследователем и преподавателем, но он будет успешен и востребован на рынке труда именно как практик. данная гипотеза проверяется авторами статьи путем сравнения фгосов по аспирантуре и магистратуре. в частности, сравниваются основные характеристики профессиональной деятельности и требования к выпускным квалификационным работам магистрантов и аспирантов. english abstract: transformation of postgraduate programs into the third level of higher education actualizes issues of organizational and methodological support of the educational process of preparing of highly qualified personnel. 01.09.2015 the majority of the federal state educational standards, which regulate higher education of the third level, have been enacted. it requires a fundamental restructuring of existing curricula, educational programs, creation of new forms of final certification. at the same time, the question about the distinctions between the second (masters) and the third (postgraduate) levels of higher education remains open. from the author’s point of view, this distinction is not a formal, but it is the essential. this distinction be generated by differences in the tasks that need to be addressed at each of these levels. one level does not automatically replaces another. we can not say that the post-graduate student — is an improved master’s. masters of the economy should be able to manage the economic process, and “researchers. teachers-researchers “in” economy “should be able to explore the fundamental and applied problems in various areas of the economy. this means that people who successfully complete the master’s degree does not automatically become a good researcher and a lecturer, but he (she) will be successful as a practices (manager). this hypothesis is tested the authors by comparing the federal state educational standards postgraduate education and master. in particular, they compare the main characteristics of professional activity, the professional competences and the requirements for the final qualifying work of undergraduates and graduate students.	sociology
the article reflects on the fruition of the poetic gender by illiterate children through the shared moments with them in the nursery schools’ daily. this living, linked to the poesia e infância14 research project, demonstrated the relevance in giving children an intense contact with poetry, singular text that enables them to express, in their own language, the way they interact with the other and the world. by means of weekly meetings with children from to years-old of two schools in the rio pardo/rs valley region, we could perceive an extreme opening of the childhood to the word and sonorous games. in the continuity of the research, we could study the textual characteristics that were more valued by children in the listening of poetic texts. one hypothesis was that the regular hearing of poems would enhance the repercussion and resonance, aspects pointed out by gaston bachelard as intrinsic to the poetic musing, experience given by the reading/hearing of the poetry and that allows the reader to find “a my non-i that permits living my confidence of being in the world” (bachelard, p. 13) . anchored in the obtained results, this text defends the rhyme and predominant discourse in poem as essential factors to the little ones to experiment the poetic resonance.	sociology

in an african society, every african has to make a run even for their basic amenities. these basic amenities fall into the control of the whites, especially in south africa. it will not be made available to them because of the control that the whites have imposed on the africans. though the scenario has slightly changed in the twenty first century, situation is that the phenomenon is still prevalent. and the reason seems to be that the lives of the african slaves which were totally occupied by the whites in the colonial period continued its effects on them and their plight was that of an animal. this leads to the fact that an african pays no regard to any value or people in the society even in the 21st century. most of the africans are not out of the shackles and hence lead a life lower than that of the animals and the white people show little regard to a fellow human’s life. the basic survival instinct makes him/her a selfish being. hence there is an immediate requirement for a change to be created among the african people so that they are taught to take care of themselves. education is a dire need of the african people, if their status has to be increased in par with other countries of the world. a literary work written, in this case in english, about an african society would definitely discuss about their way of living and the degraded status which their life bears. nadine gordimer is one such writer. she has lifted the mirror up to nature in trying to portray the life of people in african society.	sociology

the paper analyzes the main developmental directions of the theory of physical education. it is deduced that the integral function of the modern system of physical culture is recreational and educational. it is disclosed the social mechanism of self-development of physical culture, which manifests itself in a dialectical unity, on the one hand, of human activities aiming to meet the diverse needs in the use of exercise, and on the other, of public evaluation of such activities. on this basis, basic directions of historical development of physical culture are defined as follows: religious, educational, entertainment, recreation. it is shown that the theory of physical education discloses the development of physical culture in context of cultural and historical process, and special theories describes the functioning of its various social forms through the prism of today.	sociology

british sociologist richard hoggart (1918-2014) is today an authority in social sciences. the uses of his work in france allow for an examination of the forms taken by working-class culture, but also of the perceptions and uses of this notion by the intellectuals. indeed, if his work highlights the historicity of the concept of working-class culture, the discourses and analyzes that surround it also reflect it in their own way. initiated in the 1950s, disseminated in the 1960-1980s, commented on later, his work is, in fact, at the heart of very political questions about the durability or transformation, the centrality or, on the contrary, the marginalization of the culture and the identity of the working-classes, in the dual context of the triumph of mass culture and deindustrialization.	sociology

abstract the aim of this paper is to elucidate the features of the policy-making mechanism of japan's council for science and technology (cst) focusing on the policy-making processes of comprehensive recommendations. the cst is the highest decision-making organization in japan's science and technology administrative process and the recommendations have a great influence on the direction of national science and technology policy. the main results are as follows: in the cst, the organizations are never static but very flexible. the dynamic creation of deliberating groups occur in accordance with the development of the policy plan. thereupon, the incessant negotiations between internal groups of the related ministries are very essential, and the policy-making process is achieved in this interactive way among the policy-makers in participating organizations. in this process, the dual-post holdings (dph) in the vertical direction of the hierarchy can be seen frequently within the cst. this plays an important role in communication and is a very effective method of information transfer and consensus-building in policy formation requiring a high degree of expertise such as science and technology.	sociology

neoliberal ideologies, marketization and performative regimes ssociated with recent reforms in universities have exerted considerable pressure on academic working conditions and subjects in recent years. while analysing these pressures is important, it is also productive to consider the ways in which academics engage in moments of resistance by mobilising resources beyond those of critique. this paper therefore focuses on joy and positive affect in the everyday moments of academic life. it utilises the feminist methodology of collective biography to explore ways of making the restricted spaces of our working day more expansive and finding within them unexpected openings for joy. our analysis of the stories included in this paper traces the mercurial and ambiguous affective atmospheres of academic work. we suggest that joy is founded upon connections with others, that it arises in different academic spaces and that it can lead to revised knowing of ourselves. we argue that the glimpses of joy evident in this paper provoke affective attunement within the everyday, sensitizing us to other fragments of joy and providing strategies to strengthen that resistance.	sociology

hey ananta punya , a dance-drama adapted and choreographed by the bangladeshi choreographer warda rihab was performed in kolkata, india, in december 2009. rihab plays the main character srimoti, a dancer at the court of king ajatashatru. srimoti embraces buddhism but is not allowed to practice since ajatashatru decrees hinduism to be the state religion. in the narrative, hinduism, the predominant religion of india, represses buddhism, which is a minority religion in the subcontinent. even though on the surface the dance-drama deals with hinduism and buddhism, the performance is complicated by the knowledge that the choreographer and most of the performers are bangladeshi muslims. in the context of hindu-muslim conflicts and india's political and economic hegemony in south asia, the performance can be considered as a critique of india's policies. in considering the choreographer's background and the dance-drama's narrative, aesthetics, and location of performance, i analyze the various structures of power that a bangladeshi female choreographer operates within during her training and performance in india. hey ananta punya is significant because it points to the complex web of issues involving politics, history, and religion that have been a part of dance in bangladesh for the past few decades because of india's influence in the field, particularly through indian-government scholarships for advanced dance training. in the paper, i use michel foucault's theory of power as systems of interrelated networks and knowledge as a system of power to show how dance as a form of embodied knowledge can function as a tool in shaping, disseminating, and expressing ideology.	sociology

in academic world, the terminology of character, akhlak, morals and ethics are often equated. however, it will be differentiated. this paper will elaborate comprehensively both in perspective of the derivation of the words, theory, related science and its implementation in education. among some experts who have different arguments such as althof, berkowitz and victor battistich differentiate these fourth terminologies in terms of theory and implementation. both of these figures state that if moral and ethical theory is derived from philosophical theory. on its implementation, moral education tends to have a narrower scope, for instance only on cognitive development while character education has wider and comprehensive scope. in addition, yoke suryadarma and ahmad hifdzil haq state the difference of these the fourth terminologies in the barometer and its implementation. the argument of these two figures refers to the opinion of imam al-ghazali, who states that morality is not merely acts, or just the ability to do, not just knowledge also. however, moral is an effort to integrate akhlak with the situation of the soul who are ready to bring up good and bad deeds, not just for a moment but forever. this article exerts a descriptive analysis approach, which is based on analyzing all the fourth related terminology arguments in the perspective of the derivation of the word, theory, related science and its implementation. keywords : character, ecthic, attitude and terminologi of character	sociology
남중국해는 세계 교역 물동량의 1/3이 거쳐 가는 중요한 무역 항로이자 어족자원과 해저자원이 풍부한 지역이기 때문에 미국과 중국, 인접 동아시아 국가들에게 지정학적으로 매우 중요한 해역이다. 2015년부터 남중국해를 두고 미국과 중국의 갈등이 점차 심화되고 있다. 중국은 해양강대국으로 부상하면서 미국이 20세기 초부터 동아시아 해에 구축한 해양질서에 순순히 따르는 것을 거부하면서, 남중국해에 건설한 인공섬들에 군사기지를 설치하면서 해양주권 확대를 시도하고 있다. 항행의 자유의 역사를 살펴보면서 항행의 자유라는 개염이 어떻게 형성되었는가를 먼저 살펴본 뒤, 미국이 19세기에서 20세기 초에 동아시아 해역에서 어떻게 해양질서를 구축했는지를 살펴볼 것이다. 그런 후에는 2015년부터 미국이 중국을 견제하기 위해 남중국해에서 실행하고 있는 항행의 자유작전을 추적하게 될 것이다. 하지만 이러한 미국의 자유작전에 대해 중국은 지속적으로 저항하고 있으며 남중국해에 방공식별 구역 선포를 준비하고 있다. 일부 해양 전략가들은 오늘날 남중국해 미중 분쟁이 전쟁으로 발전할 가능성이 있다고 예측하기까지 한다. 남중국해 미중 분쟁의 해결사례는 결국 역사에서 찾아올 수밖에 없을 것으로 보인다. 제1차 세계대전을 전후하여 해양패권국 영국이 새로이 해양강대국으로 대두한 미국의 지위를 인정한 것에서, 또 1960년대 쿠바 미사일 위기에서 미국이 해양강대국으로 대두한 소련의 위상을 인정하고 서로가 양보와 타협으로 문제를 해결한 것에서 사례를 찾아볼 수 있을 것이다. 이러한 역사적 해결방식을 수용한다면 미국은 우선 유엔해양법협약을 비준하고 항행의 자유작전을 중단하게 될 것이다. 두 번째는 미국이 동아시아 미국 동맹국들에 배치한 미군을 점차적으로 철수시키게 될 것이다. 이는 중국으로 하여금 인공섬 건설을 중단하고 더 이상 남중국해에서 해역확대를 중단하도록 할 것이다. 물론 최종적이고 궁극적인 해결방안은 미국이 구축한 패권적인 해양질서를 평화에 기초한 새로운 해양질서로 대체하는 것이다.	sociology
the hegemony of discourse production constantly courses misunderstandings,resulting in gaps and contradiction in our consciousness. almost all the available researches on david mamet's oleanna unconsciously interprete it in the mirror of production,which has caused evasive interpretations. this paper places the play back into the tension between production and seduction both in baudriallardian sense,reading carefully the seduction scenes in the play on stage and exculpating the accused character and the equally accused playwright. the significance of the play is not in its apparent confrontation with feminism,but in urging us to break the discursive monopoly of production,and facing our seducible self,and guiding us into a conscious reconstruction of the tension between production and seduction.	sociology

for the philosopher and cultural critic bernard stiegler, the anthropocene’s deference to algorithmic governmentality has resulted in both the global banking crisis of 2007–8, and the seemingly inexorable intensification of technological unemployment. in this era, two fundamental qualities can be observed: fully automated calculation, and hyper-synchronisation; with both leading to an absence of thinking as care. if stiegler is correct, and in this era the concepts of work and employment are being made to tremble, then we are faced with a complex concern for higher education, one which suggests that the very institutions that should be trying to respond to the questions posed by technological unemployment, are at the same time subject to the conditions which might make such a response impossible. with a reading of stiegler’s recent engagement with the theme of automation, chapter outlines an approach which puts automation to work at the point where higher education institutions (heis) join with the communities and networks in which they are rooted. through the notion of ‘epistemic health’, it suggests how we can transform heis from recipients of technologically driven social change, into its careful co-creators.	sociology

anthropology is today in search of a public voice for communicating its knowledge, insights, and understanding to a broad public audience. one of the key historical voices of anthropology, the museum, has grown increasingly silent as it struggles with issues of power in the representation of native peoples and the burden of large, dated collections of material culture. the potential remains for the museum to regain its role as a voice for anthropology by ceding power and easing its overwhelming dependence on the material objects of culture. museums with a focus on public learning can serve as forums for bringing the full range of anthropological endeavor to a wide and diverse audience, reintegrating museums into anthropology will require changes in both sides of the relationship: academic anthropology will have to accept museums as a critical vehicle for public communication; and museums will have to commit to significant changes in curatorial responsibilities, exhibits, and collection practices.	sociology

foucauldian analysis of relationships between power and institutional structures has proved a powerful tool for feminist understanding. in light of it, certain practices of traditional judaism, particularly in orthodox and ultra-orthodox forms, can be critiqued as instituting regulations not simply out of religious scruples but also in tension with them, in ways that establish gender hierarchies that deny to women full religious personhood. this essay critiques the increasingly stringent and proliferating practices of meḥitzah —separation of women from public spaces—along foucauldian lines, while also arguing, against foucault, for the value of traditional institutional religious life, as a source of dignity and enlargement of the individual in his and her participation in community.	sociology

despite searle's claim of theoretical proximity between his concept of the background and bourdieu's concept of the habitus, there is at least one substantial difference in the respective ways in which these concepts have been elaborated: the background is conceived as a nonintentional neurophysiological reality whereas the habitus is fully intentional, or rather constitutes a nonrepresentational level of intentionality completely overlooked from searle's standpoint. moreover, each concept implicates a distinct perspective on social reality: the former suggests that significance is superimposed yet essentially external to this reality; the latter indicates that significance is immanent. i elaborate on the comparison between the two concepts/perspectives from different angles in order to highlight the existing differences as well as explore possible underlying affinities, which depend upon reconsidering the conventional understanding of intentionality as an exclusive attribute of mental phenomena. i show that searle's analysis of the background is inundated with indications of the undeniably intentional character of something he attempts to define as a nonintentional reality. finally, i discuss the connection between the immanence of significance in bourdieu's account of social reality and the conflict-centered orientation of this account. this dimension is noticeably absent from searle's theorizing of the social.	sociology
with this these, i wish to make sense of the impact of nostalgia and revisionism in haynes's works. more particularly, i wish to show how these two apparently paradoxical concepts actually work together in haynes's imitation and reworking of the melodrama genre. nostalgia, which by definition draws an inevitable link between past and present, has the potential to create space for revisionism. revisionism can only work if we make elements of the past interact with our present since it aims at showing what was not shown and is seldom discussed but nevertheless existed. it naturally questions our perception of the past, attempts to uncover the hidden social truths through stories, which undoubtedly existed but were to remain invisible.	sociology

дисертація присвячена дослідженню концептуальних філософсько-правових підходів до розуміння соціального контролю як засобу забезпе-чення правового порядку. доведено, що порядок і стабільність у суспільстві залежать від багатьох соціальних факторів, з-поміж яких важливе місце займає соціальний контроль як засіб саморегуляції суспільства, мета якого полягає у впорядкуванні суспільних відносин. особливої гостроти вказана проблематика набуває у правовій площині, де соціальний контроль використовується як вирішальний фактор у формуванні правового порядку. при цьому унікальність соціального контролю полягає у його здатності вбудовуватись у будь-яку соціальну систему та набувати конкретної історичної форми, яка відповідає політичному, економічному та культурному устрою того чи іншого

общественных отношений. особую остроту указанная проблематика приобретает в правовой плоскости, где социальный контроль используется как решающий фактор в формировании правового порядка. при этом уникальность социального контроля заключается в его способности встраиваться в любую социальную систему и приобретать конкретную форму, соответствующую политическому, экономическому и культурному устройству того или иного общества. доказано, что социальный контроль, как одна из важных функций управления обществом, целью которого является поддержание установленного социального и правового порядка, базируется на системе ценностей, составляющих основу социальной организации. поэтому анализ социального контроля, в его взаимосвязи с правопорядком осуществлено в исторической ретроспективе через призму доминантных в обществе базовых ценностей, которые воплощены в социальных принципах и нормах. выделены основные этапы развития социального контроля как средства обеспечения правового

правовой (государственный) и общественный контроль. the thesis is dedicated to the research of conceptual philosophic and legal approaches to understanding of social control as a mean of assurance of legal order. it has been proved that order and stability in a society depend on a number of social factors among which social order as a mean of self-regulation of society, the aim of which is to regulate social relations, plays an important role. the said issue becomes even more important in a legal dimension where social control is used as a decisive factor in formation of the legal order. at the same time uniqueness of social order is in its ability to engage with any social system and obtain specific historical form which corresponds to political, economic and cultural order of any society. during the whole history of development of the society there were nu-merous attempts to overcome certain unwelcome types of human behavior by different means as well as to engage them to act beneficially for the society or at least not to violate requirements of social norms. with this end in view each society was creating a system of social (civic and legal) control which included different means which made existence of legal order possible. the aim of the social control was to reduce violations of the established social norms and social values enshrined in them. it has been proved that social control as one of the important functions of society’s management, the aim of which is to sustain established social and legal order is based on the system of values which constitute a basis for social organization. therefore, analysis of social control in its relation with a legal order has been carried out in the historical retrospective through the prism of basic values which dominate in a society and which are enshrined in social principles and norms. basic stages of development of social control as a mean of assurance of legal control have been distinguished. it has been proved that social control as a basic mean of assurance of legal order, has an organizational and self-organizational component which is demon-strated in three aspects: social control as a result of organizational legal relations – legal (governmental) control. legal control – is a mean of organization of a social system which ensures social (legal) order through internal influence of governmental power on a society through positive law; social control as a mean of self-organization of a social system which ensures social (legal) order through available self-established social norms (civic control). it has been proved that the system of social control is composed of the following elements: socializing; subject-object; normative; methodical. quantors (attributes) of social control as a mean of provision of legal order, include: process of performance of social control is closely related to legal order (state of legal order depends on efficiency of social control); social control performs influence on a society; social control is a result of evolution social development of the society; it provides for social needs and stability of existence of a state and of the society generally; education of the members of the society is carried out through social control; social control also affects individuals and the society with the assistance of formal and informal sanctions; it is enshrined on all the level of functioning of the social system; it forms positive settings in an individual and overcomes aggression and social conflicts; it promotes adoption, acceptance by an individual of the norms, values and models of lawful behavior; consolidates and regulates activities of all members of the society; it has an appropriate set of methods that affect the individual and society. under the legal order, from the philosophical and legal point of view, it is proposed to understand legal status of the organization of legal relations, which is provided by the state and society (self-organization) and implemented through a system of normative legal, non-legal (social norms) regulation and self-re-gulation. it has been proved that the phenomenon of social control is closely connected with the issue of establishing a social order, the decisive role in maintaining of which has an understanding of social control as a result of regulation (organization) and self-regulation (self-organization). social order is a prerequisite for the existence of a society, because as long as there is order – there exists a society. just as a society depends on order, and the order depends on society. if a society is ready for change, it is mutually agreed, a single whole, then the order becomes more flexible to internal changes in society. organization of social control means control by the state by legal means. organizations of the law and order typically has the following features: social system artificially created by a man; functioning of the system provided by a man, in particular, by the appropriate bodies and officials, dully authorized the-reto; the duty of the organization of the order imposed on the state; organizational and legal means of ensuring legal order as appropriate means, forms, mechanisms, which are enshrined by the state for protection of interests of the whole society; governmental (legal) control exercised by the state, which is the main instrument for achieving legal order through organizational aspects. it has been proved that the basis of social and legal order is the processes of self-organization. self-organization of legal order is characterized by the following features: it is the basic element of the organization of law and order, on the basis of which the state organization of legal order is carried out; clear awareness by the subject of its social interests, which are realized voluntarily and naturally; dependence of the quality of self-organization of legal order and its forms on the quality of legal regulation of social relations; dependence on the level of culture and justice in a society.	sociology

t he most important characteristic of a living language,-the attribute in which resides its essential power and value,-is, that it is a spoken one; that it serves for that constant and principal bond of union between the different individuals of a whole nation, without which they could not, for a moment, be kept together as a community. this great and prevalent characteristic is, therefore, everywhere visible in its structure, arrangements and expression; hardly less so in books, than in conversation. the main object, indeed, to which every other is sacrificed, in the formation of a language is, to facilitate personal intercourse; to enable one human being, in the easiest and most direct manner, to communicate to another his thoughts and his wants, his feelings and his passions; and to this great object every living language is essentially, and, it may almost be said, is exclusively adapted in its vocabulary, its forms, its inflexions, idioms, and pronunciation. the easiest and best method, therefore, for persons of all ages and all classes to learn a living language is undoubtedly to learn it as a spoken one; since this is not only its paramount characteristic, but is the only foundation on which the written language has been built or can rest. persons, then, who have the opportunity, should learn the living language they wish to possess, as it is learnt by those to whom it is native. they should reside where it is constantly spoken, and use it as it is used around them. it should be the minister to their hourly wants, and the medium of their constant intercourse. even the books they read should be chosen with reference to the habits and peculiarities of the spoken idiom that produced them, and in studying the language itself, it should be pursued less as a foreign language than as one which they may claim among their birthrights. this is the natural method, and is, no doubt, the most effectual and the easiest. only a few persons however are able or willing to avail themselves of it. if we wish to instruct our children in a foreign language, we find it inconvenient and unwise to send them among strangers in a strange land to learn it: and, if we undertake to teach them at home, we shall hardly be disposed, like montaigne's father, to surround them only with those who speak no other than the one we wish them to acquire. in the vast majority of cases, therefore, we must resort to means somewhat more artificial and indirect; and, while still endeavoring to teach it as a living and a spoken language, use the best method within our power at home.	sociology

this chapter introduces the pedagogical foundation of the roskilde model, i.e. the concept of problem-oriented, interdisciplinary and participant-directed project work (ppl). the aims of this pedagogical concept are to support the social relevance of studies, to guarantee high academic standards, to make studies meaningful for students, to facilitate motivation, and to develop innovative and creative skills. the focus will be on the practical and theoretical reasons for introducing the concept, and on a comparison with the related educational concept of ‘problem-based learning’. first, we present a brief exposition of the political background for introducing the pedagogical concept. secondly, we present the didactic and pedagogical ideas that were developed to underpin the concept, drawing inspiration from german qualifications theory and constructivist learning theory. we then explain the concepts of ‘problem-based learning’ and ‘project work’. finally we offer a discussion of the common and divergent features of the concept of problem-based learning (pbl) and the roskilde model (ppl).	sociology
abstract the induction and mentoring of new academic staff are becoming urgent concerns because growing numbers of vacancies will appear as the ‘baby‐boom’ generation of academics retires. new recruits will have to engage with the new, complex mandates with which higher education institutions are being charged. evidence from a study of new academics is set alongside recent north american research into mentoring arrangements for new academics. it is suggested that, on the evidence we present, current british practice falls short of north american recommendations. however, it is claimed that whatever attention is paid to mentoring, its impact cannot be detached from the culture of the departments and teams within which academic staff work. by themselves, better mentoring arrangements cannot resolve looming problems in the induction of new academics.	sociology
the present work has as general objective the possibility of relativizing, or not, a vulnerability to the violence of the crime of vulnerability (article 217-a, caput, of the penal code). to do so, first, it is explained that it is the sexual crimes, as well as those practiced in the face of the vulnerable, explaining their particularities. it is one of the biggest on this subject, since, in the july issue of the high court of justice and a current criminal law, there are still divergences regarding the possibility of relativizing an age vulnerability of the victim of the crime cited. this study studies are the methods of the bibliographic and documentary of research, with the formalised study, such as current effective methoding, thus enable, consult the doctrinaciones that, after the end of the present, it is possible to identify if there is or not , a possibility to relativize an age vulnerability of violence from rape of vulnerability. as for the approach, this is classified in qualitative, it is an exploratory and explanatory study. therefore, it was possible to observe that, alongside the literal application of the law, each case should be analyzed according to its singularities, thus avoiding that injustices can be committed.	sociology

the effect of the government's 'devolution settlement' on the position of england within the uk shows no signs, as yet, of departing from the tradition of british incrementalism. despite significant changes still underway, attitudes and identity have yet to show decisive changes. the paper analyses the plausibility of an english parliament and of elected regional assemblies in england, noting that administrative regionalism is progressing effectively in england. political imperatives may lead to emphasis on local government reform, particularly high-profile mayors, as an alternative to strong regional governments: but the experience of the greater london authority suggests such bodies would lack credibility elsewhere in england. l'impact de 'l'accord du gouvernement portant sur la regionalisation' qui avance la place de l'angleterre au sein du royaume-uni ne montre encore aucun signe de rupture avec la tradition britannique de la prise de decision cumulative. en depit des transformations en cours, il faut...	sociology
this dissertation focuses on variation and change in the vowel system of toronto heritage cantonese with the goal of pushing variationist research on sound change beyond its monolingually oriented core (nagy 2016) and in approaching the study of heritage languages from the perspective of spontaneous speech. it addresses the possibility of contact-induced inter-generational vowel shifts, mergers, and splits in native vocabulary. it also addresses the extent to which demographic, ethnic orientation, or language use factors may account for these changes. the data comes from the heritage language variation and change in toronto project (nagy 2011) and includes hour-long sociolinguistic interviews from toronto residents of different age, sex, and generational backgrounds speaking in cantonese along with ethnic orientation questionnaire data and a picture description task from each speaker. the mean f1/f2 of each vowel category from each of speakers were measured in native (and integrated english) vocabulary. the results show lack of vowel shifts, evidence for merger in progress of /y/ ~ /u/, and evidence for a pre-nasal split in /ɛ/. the speakers who lead in this merger and split are the ones who used the least amount of cantonese in the interview samples. the lack of the same structural changes from hong kong speakers further supports an account based on contact-induced change. these findings challenge labov’s (2007) transmission and diffusion model and suggest more sociolinguistic engagement with theoretical models of contact-induced change (cf. thomason & kaufman van coetsem 2000).	sociology

in organizations, we seek to adapt to the good practices of a relationship with nature, transforming technologies, processes and structural and productive redesign. reflections such as these motivate research supported by the institutionalist theory and the assumptions of sustainability. the general objective here is to carry out a theoretical-conceptual study on the instrumental character of the concept of sustainability in focusing to the of institutionalist theory; and to the results, the specific objectives of contextualizing the concept of sustainability (1), addressing the main concepts raised in the face of institutionalist theory (2), and analyzing the approach of the conceptual perspectives considered in this research (3). the question to be answered in this study is: what is the instrumental character of the concept of sustainability in the face of institutionalist theory? the content analysis method and data analysis techniques are applied in qualitative research, such as cleavage and categorization. as a result, it brings a virtuous circle of conceptual relation in evidence; points out inequality of behavior in organizations, making it difficult to achieve sustainability; criticism points to the lack of employee awareness of the rules. we also look at organizational levels that reflect on sustainability. conceptual applicability converts the commitment to protect and conserve natural resources, while at the same time channeling real benefits to all who are around the institution that promotes the activities. these concepts will result in a balance between the constraints that lead to scarcity and progress on the sustainability tripod; are isomorphic measures that are somehow beneficial in the relationship between the environment and the social and economic.	sociology

abstract the portrayal of the librarian as an uptight, stern, dowdy “shhhush”-meister is a popular madison avenue cliche. recent advertisements playing off the stereotype sell everything from rum to cars. reacting to this superficial image, actual librarians are fighting back, whether collectively by forming web sites spoofing the stereotype of their profession, or individually by speaking up, as when a web site posted insults by a chicago law student. but the backlash against the stereotype is the outward reaction to a much more serious crisis of threats to basic library practice. the de-emphasis of trained librarians in a system with increased clerical personnel has left librarians feeling pushed aside. as library services have become outsourced and subdivided, there has been a dilution of responsibility for librarians, and with it, a rising tide of dissent toward stereotypes that in the new context of threatened careers feel not just silly, but dehumanizing, and an endorsement for change in myriad forms.	sociology
global restructuring process aggravated informalization of labour leading to multiple labour subjectivities and exploitations where women are the most affected. the possibility of bringing out gender as a key factor in the conceptualizations of labour and the informal sector in the era of globalization is explored in this paper. one of the main propositions here is that gender, restructuring of the economy and the informal sector are three significant realms where the present debates on labour could focus. feminization of labour instigates new forms of labour and working conditions. the argument here is that such a new categorization of production and work relations is now integrally linked with the reality of existence and survival. the paradigm shifts in the labour arena—informalization and feminization—give varieties of interpretations to the meaning of labour and economy. locating gender as a significant element in the labour discourse in a post-structuralist frame is attempted in this paper. this methodology follows exploration of the contradictions and complexities of living gender beyond the analysis of the economic structures. the approach in this paper is not to delink labour from its materialist dynamics, but to locate materialism within the ‘life-worlds’ of the workers.	sociology

the author provides a sociological analysis of sheptytsky's relationship to ukrainian catholics in the first wave of immigration to western canada in the early 1900s. the author, in the light of several contemporary sociologies of religion and immigration, argues counter-intuitively that religion in a time of unsettled lives is not always a conservative factor but can create new and dynamic strategies of action. in the formidably new canadian prairies, the ukrainian immigrants were not passive sheep, content with their spiritual desolation and isolation, but drew on their cultural tool kit to create ways to address the lack of priests and spiritual leadership, a lack which sheptytsky initially did not understand but would later address when the threat of ukrainian catholic immigrants joining up with presbyterians and french roman catholics came to the fore. both groups would prove unsatisfactory, and so the creation of the ukrainian greek orthodox church came about. the author critically suggests that such a development was, at least sociologically speaking, not so much a complete failure as the culmination of a dynamic and vital process of self-definition and cultural survival.	sociology

while george lamming portrays paternal identity, alienation and exile as thematic preoccupations of in the castle of my skin and season of adventure, father absence remains a major concern in his artistic depictions of fatherhood in these narratives. the phenomenon of father absence creates a void which the mother must additionally fill, and the presence of this void provokes as well as fosters androgyny. androgyny is the state of having traits of both genders and refers to the opposites within. thus, the two texts bring the notion of the synthesis of the masculine and feminine principles in the human psyche fully to the fore. the key mother characters in both novels exhibit the image of carl jung’s “father archetype” which is categorised as stern, powerful and controlling. reading these mother characters as “female fathers” forces the attention from them as women and mothers, hence, radically unsettling the conventional notion of who a father is. using jung’s psychoanalytic concept of anima/animus as framing and analytical tools, this paper challenges the stereotypical portrait of the hegemonic male parent and furnishes an option for a re-envisioning of masculinity and fatherhood in the context of parental authority, role performance and conduct. it construes, arguably, that the abilities of the mother characters to bear and rear children, cross gender role boundaries and compensate for their offspring's absent fathers, are irrefutable. in this way, both novels do not just recommend themselves as masculinist texts, but they also show how the mother characters qualify as fathers, albeit, female fathers.	sociology
this paper addresses the issue of social diversity, with reference to the phenomenon of tourism in italy. social inequality influences numerous socio-economic phenomena: tourism has been scarcely examined under this perspective. tourism has significant effects at social level: both on travellers and on the inhabitants of the visited regions. italy that is one of the most important touristic nations is significantly affected by the phenomena we are studying and, therefore, is an ideal context to analyse and identify the characteristics of tourism and its interaction on various aspects of social diversity. we could consider the interactions on tourism by persons with different economic and social conditions, race, gender, age, religion, mentality. these issues are usually considered by qualitative approaches. this paper attempts to give a quantitative dimension to these phenomena looking for possible statistical and administrative sources. we examined some, direct and indirect, official sources of the national statistical system and other sources disseminated by european projects and research institutions. to get a more detailed picture of a particular form of social tourism, we used the data provided to us by a very active association in this area. this study is only a first approach in order to find a strategy to help assessing some quantitative characteristics of accessible tourism. the development of this type of tourism shall imply actions, techniques, and policies aimed at reducing the problems about social diversity in the sector, in order to make tourism become a factor of social inclusion.	sociology

in a recent masterful article, professor robert sanger revealed that, since the supreme court’s decision in atkins v. virginia, some prosecution experts have begun using so-called “ethnic adjustments” to artificially raise minority defendants’ iq scores, making such defendants – who would otherwise have been protected by atkins and, later, by hall v. florida – eligible for the death penalty (iq, intelligence tests, “ethnic adjustments” and atkins, am. u. l. rev. (2015)). sanger, accurately, concluded that ethnic adjustments are not logically or clinically appropriate when computing a person’s iq score for atkins purposes, and relied further on epigenetics to demonstrate that environmental factors – such as childhood abuse, poverty, stress, and trauma – can cause decreases in actual iq scores, and that “ethnic adjustments” make it more likely that such individuals – authentically “intellectually disabled” – will be sentenced and put to death.i agree with professor sanger, but wish to shift the focus here to the role of prosecutors in perpetuating this state of affairs by endorsing and sanctioning the use of “corrupt science” in the cases in question. here, i conclude that legal and moral corruption similarly permeates what some of these prosecutors do in these cases. the article proceeds in this manner. first, i review the sad and shabby story of prosecutorial misconduct in death penalty cases in general, with specific focus on this misconduct in cases involving defendants with mental disabilities. here, i will look carefully at the scandalous story of dr. james grigson – known morbidly as “dr. death” – who regularly testified fraudulently on behalf of the state at the penalty phase of multiple death penalty cases, even after he lost his license to practice psychiatry, using, in virtually every case, “junk science” as the basis of his opinions. next, i look at some of the specific issues that are raised in cases involving defendants with intellectual disabilities in cases in which state experts testify in support of “ethnic adjustments” to iq scores, issues that go beyond the scope of the atkins and hall decisions. after this, i consider whether there is any meaningful distinction between what was done by the state in the cases discussed by sanger, and what was done in the cases involving fingerprints, autopsies and laboratory reports, discussed some years ago by professor giannelli, and whether the use of such testimony is yet another example of the sort of “corrupt science.” i next consider all of this through the filter of therapeutic jurisprudence. here, i argue that the introduction of “ethnic adjustment” testimony is as corrupt as putting on witness stand a fact witness that the da knows is lying, and that a da who, in fact, does introduce such testimony should be, at the least, sanctioned by the relevant bar associations, and perhaps, be prosecuted criminally. finally i will offer some modest conclusions, focusing on the need for defense counsel to familiarize themselves with these issues so that they can vigorously challenge the credentials of these experts on voir dire.	sociology

this study aimed to understand the movements of continuities and discontinuities in contemporary conceptions of marriage from the perspective of couples in long term marriages, that is, those that last longer than years. seven couples (mean age = 68.9 years) who were married for 45.7 years on average. semi-structured interviews with each couple were carried out (dyad). the results showed that respect for freedom to marry and divorce seems to be the innovation that most affected the interviewed couples. participants had to restructure their marriage conceptions in order to deal with the new possibilities that emerge nowadays. perceived changes are associated with the behavior of couples in contemporary days and not to the structure of marriage as institution, seen as stable and reliable.	sociology
this article explains the negotiation space between worship and economic practice on friday prayer at masjid ulul albab (mua) medan. the main focus of this study is the appearance of pedagang kagetan (sudden traders) on friday prayer laying down their merchandises such as worship equipments, moslem clothing, meal, snack, mineral water, etc around the mosque. the finding of this article is the phenomenon of changing function of the mosque to a market. to understand this phenomenon, two questions appear: what are the factors that contribute to the negotiations of worship and conomic practice, and how the economic practice progress. this paper explains that the factor pushing this situation is the blur between the room of worship and economic boundaries. thus there is dominance of economic practice in the worship space. it happens because there is mutual need between merchants and pilgrims. it is done to meet the needs of the merchant family.	sociology
kiran desai’s novel the inheritance of loss (2006) depicts the lives of its main characters – a judge, his 16-year-old granddaughter sai, and the son of their cook, biju – at specific moments in india’s colonial and national history and amid a fast-changing, increasingly globalized world. in contrast to celebratory versions of globalization lauding connection, hybridity and cultural plenitude, the text uses the idea of the invisible script or hidden private narrative to foreground the problems of injustice and inequality as part of its overall critique. deploying a self-reflexive narrative style which combines humour, a sense of the grotesque, and the tragic, the text presents an emotional and affective parallel to the political and economic complexities of postcolonial globalization. it uses symbolic images of loss and its emotional cognates such as loneliness and diminishment to argue that the hidden narratives it relates more accurately represent the cost of a global world. in the end, the novel’s conc...	sociology
the highly competitive quest for a tenure-track position in performance studies puts junior faculty in high-stakes situations. this narrative essay is the first in a three-part story about barbie and the martha—two graduate school friends who are navigating the tenuous waters of their first full-time teaching positions. the author employs self-referential academic humor to explore the challenges new faculty face in securing and maintaining their jobs and academic integrity.	sociology
while scholarship indicates that male sex work is likely as historically entrenched as female sex work (west & devilliers, 1993), sex work has generally been conceived in the sociological imagination in relation to heterosexual norms, with women as the providers of the sex acts and males as the consumers or organizers of the sexual exchange. reviewing existing literature, this paper explores the myriad discourses that have served to regulate male sex work, categorizing modes of regulation through a discursive lens. although male sex workers were historically exempt from the formalities of the criminal justice system and regulatory techniques such as mandatory medical examinations and licensing, the prohibition of homosexuality constituted a symbolic act that discursively constructed and reinforced notions that male sex workers were sexually deviant, pathological and contributed to the spread of hiv.	sociology
distance learning—that is, providing education to students who are separated by distance and in which the pedagogical material is planned and prepared by educational institutions—is a topic of regular interest in the popular and business press. in particular, moocs (massive open online courses), which are open-access online courses that allow for unlimited participation, as well as spocs (small private online courses), are said to have revolutionized universities and the corporate education landscape. in this article we provide a nuanced analysis of the phenomenon of online distance learning. we first provide an overview of its historical evolution, and subsequently define and classify key concepts. we further discuss in detail the optimal target group in terms of participating students and teaching professors and propose corresponding frameworks for driving intrinsic student motivation and for choosing a successful online teacher. we also outline the benefits that institutions can achieve by offering online distance learning. finally, we speak about the specific connection between online distance learning and social media by focusing on the difference between moocs based on traditional lecture formats (xmoocs) and connectivist cmoocs.	sociology
social innovation, one of the main references of contemporary european policies, is a tool to design and implement new organizational and institutional models to contrast poverty andvulnerability and to promote practices of inclusion and active participation of citizens in the construction of new social policies. the literature on the subject underlines the need for theconnection between research, practice, and policy making in the production of effective social innovation. in this perspective, research is conceived not as a process that “uses” professionalpractices to elaborate its own theories, but as a participatory learning path that produces an impact that is concrete and appropriate to the needs of the context.the activity theory is a particularly effective framework to analyze this process, addressing the issues of community, professional cultures and artifacts, also seen in the dynamic perspective oflearning and changing the patterns of meaning and practices of the actors and institutions involved.the article discusses the risks associated with a neoliberal conception of social innovation, placing the burden entirely on intermediate bodies, and describes the practice of territorial laboratories (labt) born as a development of the p.i.p.p.i. ministerial program, proposing to use the theory of activity as a theoretical framework to understanding the relationships betweenresearch, practice and policy making.	sociology

gapmending strategies: impact on social workers occupational practicegap-mending is a concept, which is used to create reflection and analysis of gaps that exist between different actors in social work. the gaps can be explicit or implicit distinctions between individuals, groups or organisations in social work. the gap-mending concept is not a specific model or method, but should be seen as an analytical approach or strategy that can be used in contexts where people meet in common efforts to resolve problems and prevent gaps. since the school of social work at lund university has given a social work course whiuch is based on the gap-mending concept. on the course social work students and people from different service user organisations study together. the course is titled the mobilising course. between and the mobilisation course has been given times.

thousands of demonstrators crowded trafalgar square on a chilly april afternoon in to protest the planned expansion of nuclear fuel reprocessing operations at the windscale reactor in rural cumbria. toward the end of the rally, a young woman faced the mass of protestors from behind the podium. “i am here to bring you greetings of solidarity from the various european, australian, and japanese anti-nuclear movements,” she announced. she explained that the movements whose greetings she brought to london represented “a great wave of transnational determination to put a stop to windscale, to put a stop to a nuclearized, militarized europe.” within the next few moments, she described the contours of this “transnational wave.” she took her audience from aboriginal territory in australia, where green ban strikes interfered with uranium mining, to the nonviolent demonstrations against reactor construction in german villages, and back to windscale, where protesters demanded a stop to nuclear fuel reprocessing. in the few minutes she stood at the podium, petra kelly narrated an around-the-world journey that had taken her most of the previous two decades to complete.	sociology

abstractthis article uses critical discourse analysis in order to discuss the equity and social justice implications of an envisaged education reform agenda in cyprus, as articulated by two consultation reports commissioned by the world bank. the reports highlight, inter alia, the imperative to improve teaching and enhance accountability regimes with regard to students’ learning. selected extracts from these documents are analyzed in order to highlight the absence of a social justice discourse in the rhetoric of educational reforms, despite the alleged centrality of a social justice discourse in official policy. the reports fail to include issues of social justice and learner diversity in discussing the necessity to strengthen the existing teacher policy framework and to mobilize structural educational reforms. this omission is indicative of the neoliberal imperatives that drive the envisaged education policy reforms as well as the low priority attributed to issues of equity and learner diversity, with pa...	sociology

in the development of genetics it is possible to see definite levels of investigation. every level has its characteristic methodology, which includes a set of methods, a subject of investigation, an evaluation, and an interpretation of the results obtained. the beginning of every level is connected with one or a group of scientists whose work and publications produce the beginning of a new level. the beginners and the levels are as follows: 1) g. mendel, “the cell-the feature”; 2) t. h. morgan, “the chromosome-the feature”; 3) o. t. avery et al., “the dna molecule-the feature”; and 4) v. gilbert et al., 1975-1977, “the dna (rna) nucleotide sequence-the function”. one can notice that a change of levels occurs at almost every 30-year period. we are now in the last third of the fourth level of investigation. when the new level appears, the methodological characteristics that will change the present ones will be impossible to foresee. (in reference to the levels of investigation, see problemos 48: 56-66). the development of world-wide science (genetics) could be visualized graphically as a line rising upward through many years and levels. with every new disco­ very new data are located at the top, which prolong the line. the line of scientific development in a country, in an institute, and in a laboratory, or the line of scientific activity of a scientist will continue at the lower position, as a part of the whole; the distance between these two lines is expressed by the magnitude delta- . the small meaning of delta shows that the work, publication, or scientist is near world-wide science; the large meaning of delta shows the high extent of lagging behind present day world science. the world-wide science line is the background for scientific work evaluation: the line goes through levels and at 30-year periods between the levels it goes through the methodological yearly news. if it is important to determine the delta of a work, it is necessary to compare the methodology used in this work with the methodology used according to the world line. the line of scientific activity of a person is under the influence of multiple factors. the line of the scientists at the beginning of activity (doing candidate or contemporary doctoral dissertation work) goes near and parallel to the world-wide science line. after obtaining a particular degree, a declination of the world line appears with the age and absence of renovation of methodology, if the scientist remains in the laboratory as a working person; this is the natural manner of the delta increase. if a scientist begins an administrative career, honorary titles, degrees, posts, and salaries make the declination marked. the line becomes almost horizontal and the delta increases with scientific progress. there are rare exceptions, i.e., a highly positioned scientist with a small delta. at present, the high rate delta scientist whose dissertation was made in a high-rate delta laboratory usually appears after obtaining a habilitated doctorate degree or a simple doctorate. it is very dangerous for scientific development when such a high delta habilitated doctor appears in scientific organizational institutions.	sociology
starting from the relationship between urban planning and mobility management, tema has gradually expanded the view of the covered topics, always remaining in the groove of rigorous scientific in-depth analysis. during the last two years a particular attention has been paid on the smart cities theme and on the different meanings that come with it. the last section of the journal is formed by the review pages. they have different aims: to inform on the problems, trends and evolutionary processes; to investigate on the paths by highlighting the advanced relationships among apparently distant disciplinary fields; to explore the interaction’s areas, experiences and potential applications; to underline interactions, disciplinary developments but also, if present, defeats and setbacks. inside the journal the review pages have the task of stimulating as much as possible the circulation of ideas and the discovery of new points of view. for this reason the section is founded on a series of basic’s references, required for the identification of new and more advanced interactions. these references are the research, the planning acts, the actions and the applications, analysed and investigated both for their ability to give a systematic response to questions concerning the urban and territorial planning, and for their attention to aspects such as the environmental sustainability and the innovation in the practices. for this purpose the review pages are formed by five sections (web resources; books; laws; urban practices; news and events), each of which examines a specific aspect of the broader information storage of interest for tema.	sociology

based on our ethnographic work in a venezuelan prison, we discuss how state power withdraws from the carceral space, which fosters the emergence of forms of inmate self-rule. the state’s abdication of its traditional disciplinary role constitutes a displacement of a prison order produced “from above,” to one produced “from below” by incarcerated subjects themselves. those shifts in carceral functioning, a consequence of mass imprisonment and the eroded capacity to regulate the interned life, point to a mutation in the prison’s social position. no longer does the prison seek to discipline, treat, or normalize the poor. on the contrary, the prison concentrates, reproduces, and reinforces the exclusion of a surplus population. in this context, the prison duplicates social exclusion through institutional abandonment.	sociology
in this chapter, we consider what methods and research in conversation analysis (ca), which examines the systematic accomplishment of action in its natural ecological contexts, can bring to sociopragmatics. while ca shares some of its methods with some other approaches in pragmatics – including its data-driven focus – we begin by first focusing on two aspects of the ca method that make it distinct from other approaches to language use: transcription and collections. we then go on to illustrate through two case studies how ca methods and research can help us leverage open areas of ongoing interest in sociopragmatics. the first case study focuses on (im)politeness and speech acts, while the second focuses on inference, identity and relationships. the chapter concludes by reflecting on the intersection between ca and sociopragmatics and possible directions for future research.	sociology

british pirate publishers in the romantic period competed not only for sales in the book market, but to establish a more democratic model for the ownership of texts. attention to the material conditions and the motivations of the parties involved in producing illegitimate editions reveals how romantic authorship was shaped by interactions between copyright law, authors' impressions of their rights, and the pirates' ability to subvert those prior claims. the texts and paratexts of some of the many unauthorized editions of percy shelley's queen mab (1813) will illustrate how the political and commercial intentions of radical publishers often counteracted shelley's goals while working against the structure of the bookselling industry. out of these very conflicts emerged the conceptions of that poem and, more broadly, the ideology of romantic authorship that the radical political movement and later scholars came to know.	sociology
abstract this paper reports some findings from an esrc funded project on the implementation of national vocational qualifications (nvqs) and competence‐based vocational training. the theoretical perspective is informed by interactionist traditions within the sociology of education which bear witness to the importance of ethnographic work on policy implementation in order to explore social contexts and meanings at this level. the paper is focused on an initial phase in the implementation of nvqs in the context of youth training and special needs provision, during which the official commitment to provision for nvqs was largely displaced by other priorities of more immediate concern to those involved. the actors'situation is traced out in detail and linked with local circumstances and wider social influences on the provision of vocational training. the study provides a basis for critical consideration of a) the degree of ‘match’ between practitioners ‘problems and policy‐makers’ solutions and b) nvq policy‐m...	sociology
this article focuses on a major reform goal to advance a student-centric education in south korea and the associated issues and challenges. this research study draws upon wittgenstein’s concept of world-picture that brings to the fore the cultural influences on policy enactment. interview data with teachers and students in korea revealed two main findings: the curriculum and teaching methods in korean schools combine teacher-centredness and student-centredness; and the policy initiative to promote learner-centred education is moderated by socio-cultural beliefs and practices. the significant manifestations of world-pictures in korea are confucian norms: the priority of studying, the pursuit of credentialism, the children’s motivation to study hard because of filial piety and parental investment in private tutoring for their children. on the one hand, the policy initaitive to push for learner-centred education reflects the openness of the korean policymakers, teachers and students towards progressive education. on the other hand, the endeavours of the policymakers to move away from an exam-oriented system are vitiated by local cultural world-pictures. the experience of korea illustrates the usefulness of the notion of world-picture to illuminate the evolving and complex realities of policy enactment and outcomes.	sociology
abstractthis article investigates the place of trust in learning relations in the classroom, not only between teacher and student, but also between student and student. to do this, it will first examine a pedagogy called community of inquiry, espoused by john dewey and used in most philosophy for children courses in australia. it will then consider what different forms of trust are involved in other power relations in the classroom, particularly the rational structuralism of r.s peters, or the experiential philosophy of maria montessori. it concludes that a community of inquiry shifts the ethical learning relation in significantly different ways because for educational growth, it values ethical trust more highly than a strategic trust in logical principle, duty, truth, or cost/benefit analysis.	sociology

"the purpose of the article is theoretical analysis and generalization of the features of the management culture of ancient china, which will contribute to the enrichment of the humanities science with new knowledge about the formation of a culture of governance at the stage of the birth of eastern civilization. methodology. the methodological basis of the study is the dialectical principle of cognition, systemic, civilization, sociocultural, activity, historical approaches, major provisions of the theory and history of society, its culture and management. the general scientific and interdisciplinary methods of research are used: analysis and synthesis, induction and deduction, comparison, generalization, formalization. the scientific novelty of the results is to identify and generalize the features of the management culture in ancient china. conclusions. the main achievement of the management culture in this country is the creation of a harmoniously balanced structure of power and management, based on the sacred explanation of the world picture about the alternation of the polar forces ""yin"" and ""yang"", whose balance and harmony allow maintaining stability and order in society. the main concepts that have been formed in ancient china and have significantly influenced the further development of chinese theory, culture and art of management are confucianism, moiseism, legislation, and tao-ism. confucianism treats governance through the prism of a family, where relations between rulers and subjects are presented as a family, and management is carried out by noblemen with the help of moral norms of conduct and rituals, and not strict laws. moise focuses on the paramilitary organization of society, which involves rigor, clarity, diligence on the basis of global coercion, condemnation of aristocracy, the use of not only customs but laws in the name of justice. the legislation offers the concept of a police department based on a system of very rigid laws and harsh punishments. establishing taoism in management is a refrain from current actions that go against self-development."	sociology
being both remote and not thoroughly thought out, identification with europe among young french people of immigrant origin in lower socioeconomic groups is conducive to ambivalence, swaying between enchantment and disenchantment. our qualitative approach allows us to analyze narratives of a sense of belonging to europe based on social experiences at the fringes of the political realm, which often draws on affect. for young french people of migrant origin, identification with a european political community is often linked to subscribing to a set of humanistic values for which football is the main vehicle. a degree of disenchantment is expressed when interviewees perceive religious beliefs (whether their own or those of their peers) as ostracized because of their incompatibility with dominant values. however, the possibility of re-enchantment suggests a combination of national and european identification rather than to a clash of cultures.	sociology
the response to our recent article on journal submission guidelines (mckinley & rose, 2018) facilitates an opportunity to engage in further discussion on english language standards in published academic writing. we are grateful to paul stapleton for his response, and to the editors of the journal of second language writing for this further occasion to clarify our position. the main concerns raised by stapleton (2019) are as follows: 1. that we fail to fully consider the importance of a standard for conveying scientific findings; 2. disagreement with our suggestion that terms such ‘good’ and ‘error-free’ should be avoided in author guidelines, as it risks eroding academic standards that have been painstakingly established over time; 3. a belief that the introduction of non-standard, but globally-used, forms of language are a ‘slippery slope’ to the degradation of academic writing.	sociology
this paper puts forward the notion of pragmatic citizenship and forms part of the ongoing re-appraisals of citizenship in relation to national identity in an attempt to make it more relevant and inclusive for those with complex identities, legal status and, in particular, the stateless. using the case study of palestinians in athens to discuss relationships between citizenship, identity and statehood, this paper argues that the notion of pragmatic citizenship can be useful in such re-conceptualisations as it can take into account the potentially ambivalent and multiple feelings of belonging that migrants and those in diaspora may have. in the process it stresses that strong notions of belonging and attachment to a territorialised homeland do not have to be exclusive or problematic. the paper outlines the complexity of palestinian legal status in athens and the feelings of injustice statelessness can provoke; it then describes the process of palestinian acquisition of pragmatic citizenship in greece. however, the final section of the paper highlights that such a notion of citizenship can have positive repercussions in terms of inclusive visions of a future one-state solution to the palestinian–israeli conflict.	sociology
this article analyses the particular process by which memories of the slave experience of pulayas, parayas and similar castes are kept alive in contemporary kerala by followers of the prathyaksha raksha daiva sabha, a social and religious movement of dalits started in 1909–10 by poyikayil yohannan in central travancore. the article shows how, over time, the christian orientation of the movement was modified by its dalit leaders, making intricate use of re-memorizing the slave experience. the outcome is that new myths and concepts were developed, evolving into new practices and discourses, including prominently the narrativization of oppression and suffering and rememory of slavery as part of initiation rituals into the movement.	sociology
a conception of enlightenment that is new in both origin and prototype yet rooted in chinese tradition can be found in the works of liang shuming and zhu qianzhi, his follower in the historical field. kant maintained that enlightenment implied that the power of reason would give man the courage to use his mind. similarly, zhu qianzhi used enlightenment to define reason, putting the focus of enlightenment on religion. in doing so, on the one hand, he neglected the richness, complexity and inner evolution of the western concept of reason; on the other hand, like hegel, he dismissed the subtle but significant differences between chinese and western concepts of reason. in terms of thought, intuition, emotion, desire, practice, skill and the movements of nature, reason in the western tradition inevitably tends toward the good. the word later used to translate “reason” into chinese had already appeared in confucian and buddhist classics. reason in song and ming confucianism is an all- embracing absolute; its fu...	sociology
"two tenant revolts waged during the revolutionary war reveal the fragility of the movement in virginia and new york. in late james cleveland tried to convince tenants in loudoun county, virginia, to join him in a rent strike designed to compel landlords to give tenants better terms. shortly after initiating the strike, cleveland began encouraging people to stop paying any bills they owed, including a tax that virginia's revolutionary leaders had recently foisted on poorer rural virginians. within two years, in the spring of insurgent tenants in new york's northern hudson valley designed an armed uprising to coincide with a rumored invasion of the region by the british army. the insurgencies indicate that revolutionaries had to fight the war for home rule and the battle to rule at home simultaneously, a prospect that badly frightened men such as lund washington, who administered his cousin george washington's land, and robert livingston, jr., who owned the estate, livingston manor, on which most of the new york insurgents lived. under such stress, washington and livingston reached the same conclusions: they hoped somewhat desperately that all their opponents would be ""hang'd.""1these tenant revolts expose ambiguities inherent in the move toward independence in two states critical to success in the war against britain. tobacco produced in virginia fueled part of the economy of the british empire, and grain grown and shipped from new york, and increasingly virginia, fed people who produced cash crops throughout britain's atlantic colonies. warfare, however, inhibited production and trade because men left the fields to fight, or to avoid fighting, and both armies closed off trade routes. ravaging soldiers also took what food and supplies they needed; sometimes they promised to pay and other times they simply took what they wanted. while both regions were plagued by these similar wartime ills, support for the revolution differed dramatically. new yorkers famously, or notoriously, divided over the revolution, and virginians have been portrayed as solidly in favor of independence. more recent analysis of each region suggests more complicated divisions, and a study of tenant revolts in both provides an opportunity to offer broader analysis of colonists as they calculated their chances of winning independence and preserving their property, power, and order.when looked at together, tenant revolts in virginia and new york raise important questions about how white rural inhabitants, especially land tenants, participated in and interpreted the american revolution. what grievances, for example, did tenants in different parts of the country hope to redress during the revolution? how did they intend to achieve their goals? how did revolutionary landlords address those grievances and tactics? while historians have asked some of these questions about tenants in individual states or regions, few have examined them in broader perspective. this essay begins that process by investigating the actions of tenants in new york and virginia during the revolutionary war to uncover their grievances, analyze their relationship with the british army, explain how landlords and revolutionaries reacted, and measure their levels of success.2historians of the american revolution who focus on rural inhabitants have generally focused on freeholders, those farmers who owned land, often basing their analysis on late eighteenth- and nineteenth-century writers who linked a yeoman ideal with the republican political structure that emerged in the revolutionary era. thomas jefferson famously extolled the virtues of farmers, while others championed yeomen farmers as the personification of the republican politics espoused by revolutionaries. they began the revolutionary period lauding farmers who owned the land they occupied and improved, and by the end were insisting that honest political participation depended on land ownership. the author of the tract american husbandry, for example, admired how formers from new england to the carolmas took up ""land whenever they are able to settle it"" to become so self-sufficient that market ""consumption is scarce worth mentioning. …"	sociology

background: with the complex and heterogeneous educational environments, the challenges faced by the teaching profession are increasing day by day. teachers need to have not only theoretical and practical knowledge but also the capacity to bring about optimal levels of learning for all students. objective: the present paper reflects the extent to which teacher education programme prepares their teacher education candidates to identify the specific needs of each individual learner, and respond to them by deploying a wide range of teaching strategies in inclusive classrooms. method: reviews related to the teacher education curriculum from the perspective of learners with special educational needs and the existing two year b.ed. curriculum framework of universities of north india (jammu and kashmir, himachal pradesh, uttarakhand, punjab, haryana, chandigarh, uttar pradesh, madhya pradesh, rajasthan and delhi) were studied and compared. results: it has been found that there are no in-service training programmes for teacher educators to teach about inclusive education. teachers remain heavily biased towards learning the theory of inclusive education without opportunities to practice and gain confidence with teaching methods needed to support diverse learners. further, after critically analyzing the year b.ed. curriculum, it has been found that in the last semester (ivth) theory of inclusive schools trainees are taught for a mark course for 1-2 hours per week on an average including internal and external evaluation and no credit is given for practical part. they are provided with the understanding of the theory of inclusion schools, however their understanding this limited or almost nil. another point that has been noticed that the theory of inclusive schools has been taught after the school internship programme of weeks, which raises a question- understanding the inclusive schools/classrooms, should be after or before the internship programme? conclusion: after reviewing the existing literature and curriculum framework, it can be substantiated that there are obvious gaps in teacher preparation program. stakeholders should view these gaps as a major roadblock to the actualization of inclusion at the very basic level (the general teacher education programmes). to ensure a better match between teacher preparation and the realities of inclusive classrooms, changes to the current approaches are necessary and critical. keywords: teacher education programme, inclusive education, children with special needs, curriculum framework.	sociology

this paper seeks to respond to two particular aspects of legge's work, her development of the concept of rhetoric and her commitment to the educative process. legge has been drawing attention to the concept of rhetoric for a long time (e.g., gowler and legge, [originally 1983]; legge, 1995a). however, despite its popularity as an epithet, the process of rhetoric remains largely unexplored. locating rhetoric within a poststructuralist view of language, this paper utilizes and explores the contribution of 'the new rhetoric' to such an understanding, focusing on issues of style and context. this is used to illustrate a characterization of rhetoric which emphasizes its quality as a closed system with an important role in maintaining the status quo of 'managerialism'. highlighting the key concept within 'the new rhetoric' of audience, we suggest that to achieve change it is necessary to intervene in the closed cycle of the relationship between producers and consumers of management knowledge.	sociology
the object of this paper is to discuss some of the theoretical and methodological controversies surrounding the emerging field of bioethics, especially focusing on reproduction biotechnologies, attempting to give some examples of its implications as a network of controversies. initially, it presents the new reproduction biotechnologies in terms of the effect which they are producing on our understanding about human nature and life, as well as the context of the emergence of bioethics, traditionally conceived of as a critical and analytical example of the relationship between technology and humanity. as an alternative way of explaining these relationships, it outlines the aspect of bioethics as a network effect, in which the technology-society hybrid is shown both in the building of bioethical norms and in the instabilities which challenge these norms. as a way of understanding this heterogeneous and complex network, controversy analysis is proposed as a methodological tool. in order to illustrate the richness of such perspective, a brief empirical study is presented, in which an attempt is made to track controversies articulated around the relations between bioethics and reproduction biotechnologies, with a specific focus on stem cell research, as published by the on-line media from january of until july of raising questions about subjects such as: life, humanity, artifice and autonomy.	sociology

the use of a historical example such as nero as part of an argument defending or condemning the regicides came automatically to literate europeans of the seventeenth century who, as part of their classical education, were conditioned to use rhetorical devices, including examples and comparisons, when trying to convince readers to accept their arguments. nero had, since shortly after his death in ad been a favourite example of a tyrant, and for centuries literate europeans had shared a traditional perception of nero's iniquitous character and actions. salmasius, however, referred to nero as being not simply a tyrant but as �the worst of tyrants�. one of the major objectives of this essay is to demonstrate that this notion of nero as worse than other tyrants and indeed, with some writers, than other men was widely shared during the renaissance. secondly, i will show that it was mainly the personality of nero and especially his cruelty that was seen as justifying his exceptional status. thirdly, i hope to explain how he came to have such a reputation and the influence of rhetoric and a related moralizing approach to writing history on establishing and perpetuating it. in accomplishing these three objectives it will also be necessary to elucidate the meaning that the term 'tyrant' had for europeans of the renaissance and earlier centuries. as will be shown, the tyrant was very frequently defined in terms of his vicious personality and especially his extreme cruelty.	sociology
this chapter focuses on the pedagogic activities of teachers, who are involved in professional or work-related provisions. it uses a dual professionalism concept at the initial stage to investigate how teachers acquire and apply their teaching know-how or capacities from curriculum development to teaching strategies. the study of the acquisition of knowledge relies on concepts by clandinin (1985), shulman (1987), becher (1994) and bernstein (1996). the understanding of the application of know-how refers to theories by eraut (2004), evans et al. (2010), loo (2014) and winch (2014). in particular, recontextualisation processes are used to understand the acquisition and application of the teachers’ capacities. in so doing, a list of contextual activities is ascertained from the various recontextualisation processes. these activities are derived from the teachers’ pedagogic activities across three academic levels and varied disciplines. thus this chapter offers development of these analysed descriptive narratives and metaphors culminating in a typology of these teaching activities. the empirical data is from a project (loo, 2018) which investigates the types of teaching and learning using forms of recontextualisation to understand how certain kinds of knowledge such as occupational, disciplinary and pedagogic are acquired and applied in teaching contexts. the participants teach on pre-university or technical and vocational education and training (tvet), first-degree or higher vocational and professional education. the disciplines of these teachers include gas fitting, equine studies, fashion and textiles and airline studies at the tvet level, dental hygiene and accountancy at the higher vocational level, and the training of doctors and emergency medicine clinicians at the professional level. there are participants in total with seven from each of the three academic levels. the empirical data is drawn from a questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews and supporting documents such as curriculum specifications. the findings from the analysed empirical data offer insights into how the teachers acquire and apply their pedagogic and professional know-how. occupational knowledge refers to the teachers’ professional practices in their disciplines such as airline studies and accountancy, which are used in their teaching practices. the findings also provide additional insights into how the teachers’ capacities/know-how are selected and relocated – recontextualised – for use in the different teaching contexts and technical provisions that they deliver. in so doing, these activities offer a typology of the different recontextualisation processes about the teaching activities at the three academic levels. this typology, drawing from the different classifications of the literature review and analysed empirical data, contributes to a greater understanding of how teachers with professional practices rely on and apply their pedagogic and professional experiences to facilitate their teaching of work-related programmes. it offers different forms of disciplinary knowledge that the teachers refer to and how they make it relevant to their particular discipline. additionally, the typology points to the symbiotic relationship between teaching and professional practices, the reliance on real-life experiences as well as the appropriate teaching strategies that are employed in education. the findings have implications for occupational teachers, managers of work-related provisions, teacher educators and policymakers.	sociology

topic-specific didactical design research is a research methodology with two aims, 1) designing and improving teaching-learning arrangements and 2) generating theoretical contributions for understanding the initiated teaching-learning processes for a certain topic. the article provides methodological reflections and examples for elaborating the meaning of theorizing within this methodology. starting from a distinction of categorial, descriptive, explanatory, normative and predictive theory elements with their functions and logical structures, the examples show that theorizing in design research studies can be conceived as a process of successively developing and connecting theory elements, for the how-questions (the rationales for the arrangements) and the what-questions (the structuring of the learning content). the considerations are illustrated for the case of topic-specific didactical design research for language-responsive classrooms, particularly in relation to language learners’ conceptual understanding of fractions, variables, and percentages.	sociology

there is a fundamental need in the current century to recalibrate the responsibility of schools for student learning and recognize that successful education outcomes are achieved jointly with the support of significant others, particularly parents and the wider community surrounding the students. this argument is underpinned by an exploration of two key constructs that are of central importance to education in the 21st century: globalization and technology. globalization requires citizens to be able to deal with a complex, interconnected and rapidly changing world and create meaningful relationships with others who do not share their same cultural background. the challenge of technology refers both to the way in which learning is understood and the possible positive impact of digital devices on student learning. educational technologies have the capability to change radically the way in which effective student learning environments are created, sustained and enhanced as we move further into the 21st century. the role of teachers may need to change, therefore, from “sage on the stage to guide on the side” (king, 1993) in an era where data is readily available. the onus in such learning environments is for students to not only be able to access such data, but also transform it into valid knowledge and apply it appropriately. similarly, the capability to understand and enhance student learning is growing rapidly as the constructs of pedagogy, andragogy and heutagogy are better understood and enhanced by research. this will require a range of personal skills to be embedded in any curriculum and reduce the requirement for teachers to be transmitters of knowledge and encourage the development of self-directed and interdependent learners. consequently, school leaders need to familiarise themselves with and apply theories of adult and self-directed learning if they are to enhance the capability of their workforce and maximise student learning, which especially in the 21st century, increasingly needs to be self-managed, intrinsically motivated and collaborative. this will mean school leaders will need to constantly review curricular provision from a perspective of skills enhancement if they are to provide students with the capability to make sense of a rapidly changing world.	sociology

agent-based models (abms) are an increasingly popular tool in the social sciences. this trend seems likely to continue, so that they will become widely used in geography and in urban and regional planning. we present an overview of examples of these models in the life sciences, economics, planning, sociology, and archaeology. we conclude that abms strongly tend towards an individualist view of the social world. this point is reinforced by closer consideration of particular examples. this discussion pays attention to the inadequacy of an individualist model of society with reference to debates in social theory. we argue that because models are closed representations of an open world it is important that institutions and other social structures be explicitly included, or that their omission be explained. a tentative explanation for the bias of abms is offered, based on an examination of early research in artificial intelligence and distributed artificial intelligence from which disciplines the approach is derived. some implications of these findings are discussed. we indicate some useful research directions which are beginning to tackle the individualism issue directly. we further note that the underlying assumptions of abms are often hidden in the implementation details. we conclude that such models must be subject to critical examination of their assumptions, and that model builders should engage with social theory if the approach is to realise its full potential.	sociology
gavin arnall: you argue in the politics of aesthetics that “it is within the mimetic regime that the old stands in contrast with the new.” this makes us think of the surrealist practice of invoking the outmoded, a practice overlooked by many theorists of the avant-garde who characterize the avant-garde as inclined toward rupture, the future, and the new. do you see this romantic gesture of invoking the outmoded and utilizing it in a new way as a practice in accord with the aesthetic regime? does this practice, in other words, participate in constructing what you call “the newness of the tradition?” jacques ranciere: yes, i think so. the aesthetic regime means a rupture with what came before, the mimetic regime. the latter was ruled by an idea of the historical evolution that created a gap between the ancients and the moderns. on the one hand, the ancients were supposed to provide models. but, at the same time, they were the primitives, and it was no longer possible to do the same thing as they had done. one had to study sophocles or aeschylus, but it was not imaginable to perform their plays because they were at odds with modern refinement. i think one of the markers of the move toward the aesthetic regime is the project to present on stage the plays of greek dramatists. even the concept of the classics is linked with the aesthetic regime, which leaves open the possibility of reusing, recycling, and reinventing the ancient forms. i think it is quite an important point. you mention surrealism as a way of reusing existing forms,	sociology

the golden bell award-winning tv series falling was released in and aired by the public television service. it is a short series (six episodes) marketed as an idol drama; however, it stands out from this genre by a different narrative structure, role types and relations. it is not centered around the building of a relationship between the typical superior man (by looks and material assets) and a less-than-perfect woman (in terms of looks and typically feminine character traits), with an interfering female character possessing the traits which the protagonist lacks. it plays with this formula as it has three protagonists placed in a similar pattern of interaction, but instead of love relationships the series focuses on a growing-up process of searching for and negotiating subjectivity both by the female protagonists, and by the male one. this process takes place within a network of changing power relations in which both main and secondary characters are involved, while the primary epistemological method is gazing, an activity in which (interestingly enough) the viewer is also engaged. my presentation will first explore the extent to which falling fits within its genre and at the way in which it depicts reality, and argue that while this series borrows certain elements from the idol drama convention, it also goes beyond the genre by the complexity of its characters and by a visual strategy of laying bare a flawed reality instead of depicting a smooth and coherent, hollywood-style diegetic illusion of glamorous modernity. next, i will focus on the issue of power. although it does not reflect or advocate radical social changes, falling depicts many instances of having and not having power, actual and illusory power, and power relations, thus assessing the roles and expectations confucian families construct for people of both genders. i will engage with the feminist potential of this series and argue that falling encourages reflection on the dialectics between confucian tradition, individualism and modernity. it depicts a process of negotiating a path for women not by rejecting the confucian family, but by carefully considering the possibilities available inside it. finally, i will argue that falling constantly challenges the viewer by its very complex take on the idea of the gaze and laying bare various truths, inviting considerations on empowerment and the scope that the gaze may attain.	sociology

charity culture from the perspective of charity law belongs to the conceptual culture. it can be further divided into three levels: the philosophy of modern charity, social ideas of charity and individual consciousness of charity. at present, the social idea of charity has been preliminarily formed and systematically embodied. individual modern philanthropic consciousness has also been preliminarily molded. however, the construction of the philosophy of modern charity has a long way to go. the imperfect system and mechanism, the restriction of economic and social conditions and other factors affect the promotion of charity culture. therefore, we should take the construction of the philosophy of modern charity as the cornerstone, the implementation of charity education as the main body, and the optimization of economic and social conditions as the support to systematically promote the promotion of charity culture, so as to promote the development of charity in china. the change of charity culture will give us more understanding of chinese economic development.	sociology
"many ""first generation"" undergraduate public health degree programs were designed based on ""siloed"" course structures centered around subunits in the discipline (e.g., introduction to epidemiology, introduction to environmental health) that may be meaningful primarily to experts in the field. an alternative to the siloed approach is an integrative curricular design, in which courses are designed around meaningful thematic units (e.g., explaining public health problems, asking and answering scientific questions in public health), with an emphasis on drawing connections between knowledge from different but complementary disciplinary areas as a means to improve student learning and retention. the integrative approach shifts the curriculum conversation to capitalize on the interdisciplinary roots of the public health profession. this approach is consistent with the learning outcome recommendations in the framing the future task force report and in the ceph requirements for the undergraduate public health major. we explore integrative approaches to developing curricular models for undergraduate public health programs and discuss both pedagogical and career preparation arguments supporting an integrative curriculum approach. these include facilitating the often-challenging task for students of seeing how concepts interrelate, making transparent how ""basic"" knowledge in the discipline relates to ""real world"" applications of the content, and better mirroring how professionals in the discipline actually use knowledge in practice. finally, we review examples of core concepts and features in an integrative curriculum approach to the undergraduate public health major as an effective educational program with high-quality, learner-centered educational experiences."	sociology

research on charitable giving has tended to examine either the individual characteristics of donors, or those of households. however, both approaches overlook the interactive processes that take place within households which may influence charitable donation in a variety of ways. for example, the system of financial organisation adopted by a couple can set limits on the degree of individual financial autonomy, and this in turn can influence the financial decision-making of each partner. this paper presents the results of a study that examined charitable decision-making within the context of household financial behaviour. it investigated whether such decisions tend to be individual or joint, and the extent to which they are regarded as an integral part of household financial management. six focus groups were carried out with people who were currently married or living with a partner. the results suggest that charitable giving is dealt with in accordance with the style of money management of the household, although it occupies a more marginal position than other items of expenditure. copyright © john wiley & sons, ltd.	sociology
this article explores a recent trend in evangelical revivalism known as ‘citywide prayer,’ a movement organized around prayer networks and public rituals that highlight religious concerns deemed specific to cities and metropolitan regions. building on research that includes ethnographic fieldwork in knoxville, tennessee, and focusing on the discourse and practical strategies of citywide prayer, the article argues that advocates of this movement promote a style of evangelical urbanism in which prayer serves as a key medium for reimagining one's sense of place, against the disorientation and alienation associated with urban life. moreover, prayer is presented as a medium for marking time in non-secular terms, as is demonstrated in the use of technologies of religious discipline such as annotated prayer calendars, which invite participants to inhabit multiple coexisting temporalities. it is further suggested that when enacted this evangelical urbanism constitutes a form of urban praxis, enabling projects of ...	sociology

by reviewing the two research frames appearing in the textbooks of human geography the human mosaic by terry g. jordan and human geography: culture, society, and space(6 th edition ) by de blij et al., the author indicates that although the chinese textbooks of human geography have drawn on and accepted the jordan's frame, this frame still belongs to the traditional human geography which stresses too much on cultural ecology and the saurian cultural landscape school. however, the frame cited in de blij's above-mentioned book, which is originally from the national research council in us,shows some fresh issues and perspectives in current human geography. the development of new cultural geography has made it necessary and emergent to construct a new research agenda which can be integrated with both the old and the new human geographies. this article tries to use and redefine five concepts:attributes',spaces',times',approaches' and worlds' to build a research frame, namely astaw frame. with this astaw frame, the author expects that human geography as a discipline will be more systematic and more easily understood by non-geographers. this frame can be also expected to be used in active academic researches esp. on issues in a changing reality. astaw frame is essentially based on new cultural geographies' epistemology, approaches and world views. in this frame, the boundary of subjects esp. the boundary between geography and human geography has been understated intentionally. cultural and social factors influencing the order of nature are emphasized in the frame. the idea of regarding scientific positivism as just one of all human being's wisdom is highlighted in the paper. therefore, the new research issues in human geography as well as geography will also focus on the representational world rather than just on the real world or physical world which is usually thought of independent on human being and which is traditionally the research core of scientific geography. spatial study and representational study in new geography and human geography will emphasize the approaches of cultural studies rather than just study the cultural items in traditional and scientific spatial research perspective. the author expects this paper on the new construction of research frame of human geography will attract more attention on the cultural turn of geography and the new cultural geography in china's academic field.	sociology

"4ny attempt to relate scientific thought to ""the philosophical and j\. religious ways of seeking truth"" is a perilous undertaking. indeed i am inclined to think that in the united states, at least, the spectacular advances in physical and biological science and in engineering have tended to make the task more difficult than ever before. the fact that scientists in this century have been so successful in advancing science has led many to believe that there must be some special method which has guided their endeavours. if one assumes there is such a thing as the scientific method, one can then argue that the method must be applica ble to all human endeavours. if this be so, a widespread knowledge of the method, and a determination to apply it, might well lead to the disappearance of those problems which concern moral philosophers and at times theologians. from this it follows that there is no need to relate three ways of seeking truth; there is only one way, the scientific. so the argument goes. it is not new. i am inclined to think, however, that it is more widely accepted than ever before. to my mind the line of reasoning i have just presented is completely false. it rests on a misreading of the history of science. science did not start to prosper because a new method was formulated and applied. the growth of modern science is a complex phenomenon. any account of it must show the stumbling way in which the pioneers in each area had to struggle through a jungle of false observations and wild speculations. even today in the most sophisticated branches of natural science, ad vances are not made by the application of a single method. there are many techniques, many ways of stating problems, many methods of analysis. yet, belief in a mistaken notion about experimental science is widespread. many elementary texts in the physical and biological sciences perpetuate it. one author, for example, states that there is a series of eight steps in the scientific method beginning with the ""rec ognition of an indeterminate situation"" and ending with an ""asser tion which appears to be warranted"" and which is unified with the body of knowledge already established. such an account of the way scientists operate makes no distinction between the solution of a trivial problem and the advances which mark a breakthrough into new knowledge, a * the arthur stanley eddington memorial lecture for given at princeton university, princeton, n. j. reprinted by permission of the author and cambridge university press."	sociology
the family, as emler and abrams note in this issue, represents a highly important arena for the allocation of benefits and burdens, and so for distributive justice. indeed, every manner of noncomparable resource is exchanged. yet, as williamson and clark show, also in this issue, social norms, perhaps more implicit than expicit, prohibit us from keeping track of the many exchanges that occur. the extent to which we do keep track, and what we keep track of, may vary by relationship stage, couple orientation (desmarais and lerner), and by individual orientation (williamson and clark) with important consequences for both the level and source of partners' satisfaction. further, the allocation of benefits and burdens must serve multiple goals. as partners in this most complex relational system, family members must accommodate not only to needs for nurturance, affection, and personal development but to extensive instrumental and economic responsibilities as well. the diverse goals incorporated within the relationship have important consequences for the justice principles used. reciprocally, as the article by steil and makowski suggests, the justice principles used have implications for the way the partners feel about themselves, each other, and the decisions that are made. traditionally, as a vast literature has now shown, and as several of the papers in this issue affirm, the distribution of benefits and burdens, of economic responsibilities, and opportunities for personal development and nurturance has been unequal. the paper by emter and abrams suggests that men and women, regardless of their ideology, are fully prepared for this pattern early on. is gender then the overriding determinant of deserving in the family? or as the authors ask, is entitlement activity and benefit specific? buunk and van yperen also address the inequality issue. they ask whether or not women who find themselves overbenefited find this less satisfying than do overbenefited men. they	sociology

this article explores the creation of criminal identities in early nineteenth-century england, and more precisely examines the law’s construction of the subject in the light of the competing constructions of the criminal subject in popular discourse. this article focuses on the ambivalent discourse of the popular broadside ballads and execution sheets, and their early evolution into the police news. particular attention will be devoted to the popular construction of a criminal subject from ‘direct’ experience, namely through the whole legal process leading from crime to sentence: the investigation and the trial, and, in some cases, the execution. the broadside will be seen to constitute a first step in the creation of a distinctive aesthetic of the criminal subject. but that process was not without its contradictions: the popular narrative often reinforced dominant attitudes towards the law, but at times also reflected alternative discourses, with its portrayal of the heroic criminal rebel. indeed, the popular discourse is competing with other constructions of the crime, news reporting and the legal discourse itself, through the trial. those narratives influence the broadside greatly, and we shall see how legal changes together with shifts in the circulation of criminal news later in the century transformed both the criminal subject and popular discourses and practices.	sociology

the article briefly introduces hans albert and the basic elements of his critique of neoclassical economics as a form of ‘model platonism’. the two most important elements of his general methodological critique of economics – namely the institutional vacuum inherent in much economic modelling and its unrealistic assumptions about behaviour – are introduced. it is argued that these specific critiques have been taken up with varying degrees of success in areas of economic research such as institutional economics and in behavioural and experimental research programmes. however, the fundamental methodological gist of his critique remains as pertinent to mainstream economics as it was when originally formulated. the influence of ‘model platonic’ thinking remains pervasive in academia and also in public policy. hans albert was born in cologne, germany in 1921. he is one of germany’s most distinguished philosophers of science and one of the world’s leading critical rationalists, yet much of his work remains unknown to the english-speaking public. besides his contribution to the positivist dispute in german sociology (adorno et al., 1976),1 his two main works available in english translation are the treatise on critical reason and a compilation of essays entitled between social science, religion and politics (albert, 1999). his seminal article on ‘model platonism’ (albert, 1963) has until now been unavailable in english. the publication of the translation of it in this issue of the journal of institutional economics finally introduces this influential piece of particular relevance to economics (albert, 2012). it facilitates a better understanding of albert’s work and thought and provides a criticism of a certain type of economic ∗email: frank.maier-rigaud@oecd.org, maier-rigaud@microeconomics.de we would like to thank viktor vanberg and geoffrey hodgson for valuable comments on an earlier version. the edition is the english translation of the earlier german edition.	sociology

common-sense meanings of the 'individual' and the 'social' are examined emphasizing the fallacy of viewing them as denoting separate entities given in nature. the concept of social representations is used to explain the construction of these categories in terms of the particular systems of values, ideas and practices of different societies. the concept of social identity marks the individual-social interface interpreted as the construction of individuals in relation to the social representations of significant groups in their society. the earliest constructions of a social identity are traced in the domain of gender because this is a ubiquitous feature of social life, involving the differentiation of only two groups; they are obligatory and use physical differences to provide the signifiers in a semiotic system of social representations. empirical evidence is reviewed showing that the development of a social gender identity is a complex process and involves many aspects of children's activity slowly coming to be regulated by the particular social representation of gender dominant in their society.	sociology

the article concerns the sociology of curriculum. it is interested in the introduction of new teaching content which has become increasingly popular in quebecer schools even if some of it is not part of any ministerial policy or program. the study characterises three cultural models: therapeutic, entrepreneurial and results-based. all three refer to work carried out in the 1960s and 1970s which set within a critical approach, but the analysis shows the way in which their contribution may today be recuperated for a managerial perspective. from this basis, the authors study the new challenges of contemporary sociological criticism.	sociology

abstract like any other discourse, drug policy is imagined and articulated through metaphors. in this article, we explore the metaphors and meanings at work in the current national drug policies of australia and sweden. australia's approach to welfare is usually characterised as liberal-welfarist, emphasising individual difference and ‘freedom'. sweden's approach is usually characterised as social-democratic, universalistic and paternalistic, with an emphasis on social rights, equity and sameness. how do these models of citizenship – difference versus sameness – play out in national drug policies? what are the risks and benefits of these models and the claims they allow? in the textual analysis presented here, we focus on metaphors and meanings relating to the themes of addiction, social exclusion and gender. we choose metaphor as our major analytical tool because we think that the risks and benefits of adopting different models of citizenship in drug policy need to be understood to operate at many levels and with a high degree of subtlety and abstraction. in the cases of addiction and social exclusion, a complicated picture emerges. in australia, drug users are offered two options: sameness (and reintegration into society) or difference (and re-connection). in sweden, drug users are excluded from society but not because they are fundamentally different from non-users. because drug users are understood to be suffering from a temporary and curable personal affliction, the goal is to return them to sameness through care and treatment. with respect to gender, although differently expressed in the two national contexts and differently shaped by national imaginaries, both national policies adopt similar approaches: the unequal treatment of women transcends differences in national setting. accounts of drug policy usually focus on the degree to which drug policy is, or should be, ‘evidence-based', or on the complex political negotiations involving diverse stakeholders and interests. we suggest here another, complementary, perspective: that national imaginaries (i.e. culturally specific metaphors, symbols and beliefs, and national ideologies) shape drug policy in subtle but crucial ways.	sociology
abstract at the end of the twentieth century women's imprisonment in the united states changed dramatically. increases in the female inmate population and a move toward gender equity in corrections created a new generation of women's prisons. women's incarceration today more closely resembles men's in terms of regime and physical structure. in this study, we explore whether these institutional changes are changing women's perceptions of the racial climate of prisons. using data from two large-scale surveys administered in women's prisons in california and qualitative information from interviews with female inmates, we examine women's perceptions of racial hostility and attitudes about racial conflict in light of their current carceral setting. our data uncover no evidence of serious racial conflict among female inmates and relatively little variation in racial attitudes across institutional contexts. we discuss the significance of these findings in terms of the current discourse on penal change and wom...	sociology
: the singapore-indonesia-malaysia growth triangle has been applauded by the governments of the three nation states, economists and transnational corporations as an economic success. however, other stark realities are evident at the local level as well. the growth triangle is supplanting older cultural and economic geographies. this has given rise to struggles over rights to territories and resources. of the three points in the triangle, it is the landscape of riau-indonesia that has been transformed most dramatically. a comparative study of the cadastral maps of the administrators of the growth triangle versus the community maps of the indigenous peoples shows the differences in their perceived spatial ideas of riau. it also highlights the different systems of knowledge as upheld by the administrators in contrast to that of the indigenous inhabitants. this comparative study brings to attention the issues of knowledge construction, mapping knowledge and the politics of mapping.	sociology

"introductionthe period since the terrorist attacks of september should have been a golden age in transatlantic security relations. more importantly, it could have been. in the immediate aftermath of the attacks, there was virtual unanimity among the members of the north atlantic treaty organization (nato) that al qaeda represented a direct threat to the common values and interests of all nato members. within days, and for the first time in its 52-year history, the alliance had invoked article of the nato treaty (the ""all for one"" collective defence clause) in order to assure the us that it could count on the unanimous support of all allied governments. for its part, washington issued a series of statements which indicated that the us understood that the global war on terror (gwot) could only succeed if it was managed as a broad-based campaign of multilateral security cooperation. two-and-a-half years later, this post-9/11 world seems as remote as a fairy tale. bilateral relations between washington and key european allies are on life support. nato has more members and more missions than it did before september but there is a pervasive sense of confusion about the alliance's fundamental purpose, and a deep sense of pessimism about its future.this essay will look for some of the causes of nato's current crises. i will not apportion blame equally, because the bush administration is primarily responsible for the problems that currently plague the alliance. i will place a special emphasis on the arguments of president bush's neoconservative advisers, who have exercised such an enormous influence over us foreign policy since the attacks of september 2001. richard perle's and david frum's study, entitled an end to evil, will be accorded particular attention, since it can be read as the neoconservative equivalent of luther's theses (the religious analogy is not coincidental).' in the end, of course, george w. bush must take responsibility for his administration's policies, regardless of the influence exercised by the members of the neocon community.my critique of the bush administration will be followed by an analysis of certain arguments that have gained credence among many european intellectuals and policymakers. in this regard, i will place a special emphasis on the writings and speeches of french philosopher etienne balibar, an emeritus professor at the university of paris x-nanterres and a distinguished professor of humanities at the university of california, irvine. balibar is an articulate and influential representative of a community of postmodern, anti-statist and quasi-pacifist intellectuals who are generally suspicious of both nato and the united states. he has published several influential essays on european democratization, the evolving nature of sovereignty, and the concept of european citizenship (particularly in contradistinction to the status of sans-papiers within the borders of western europe). balibar has also written on the eu's relations with, and obligations toward, its neighbours to the east and south, and about europe's distinct role as a ""civilizing influence in the world.""2 this study will focus on these more wide-ranging statements by balibar about europe's proper place in the world.the ""martian"" excesses of the neoconservatives and the "" venutian"" fantasies of european and canadian commentators such as balibar constitute the extremes of an evolving debate about nato's proper role in the world.3 following my critique of these two worldviews, i will make a case for a new transatlantic dialogue, based upon a cluster of values which are associated with the concept of anglosphere. prior to developing these arguments, however, it is necessary to provide some basic information on the changes that have taken place in nato over the last years, with special reference to the question of the alliance's boundaries.nato's transformationduring us defence planners debated whether america should break with its long tradition of opposition to membership in entangling peacetime alliances and commit to a new multilateral security treaty with canada and selected west european governments. …"	sociology
while great improvements have been made in women’s professional advancement in sociology, it is contended that enormous sexism remains in sociological theory books, and the courses (often compulsory) associated with them. this has a broad effect in all fields within sociology, giving students the impression that men are the sources (the only in earlier times). women are included only late, in contemporary sociology and gender studies. classical theory textbooks in use over the last years were examined, some in many editions. the trend has been for women to be added in later editions, but with scant or no discussion of their views or comparison with those of men theorists. well-known women may be included (rosa parks, hilary clinton) who are not theorists at all! yet an adequate literature has been available for many years-books by women theorists and analyses of them by reputable scholars. two tables are provided: one, a chronological list of these works (to dispel the excuse of lack of material), the second (alphabetical), of sexist classical theory textbooks. finally, it is argued that this is a challenge for the profession itself, authors, publishers, and peer reviewers. inclusion and competence are both called for.	sociology

emerging research indicates that more and more indigenous peoples will be forced to migrate due to climate change. current responses focus on mitigation and adaptation strategies. one such group, torres strait islander people are already moving for other reasons and existing vulnerabilities compound levels of disadvantage when moving. it will be important to understand torres strait islander people's experiences of contemporary movements in order to inform policy development and facilitate the process of migration and resettlement as movement increases. a synthesis of existing studies would allow the development of sensitising concepts that could inform future research in the torres strait islander context. this article presents a metasynthesis of six qualitative studies of the experiences of different indigenous and minority groups at various stages of migration, displacement and resettlement. articles were selected on contemporary movements (2001-2011) and importantly the inclusion of first person voice. reciprocal translation was used to synthesise common themes and a core construct. the overarching construct that became apparent from the metasynthesis was 'continuity of being' through staying connected to self, family and culture. three themes emerged: 'freedom to be', 'staying close' and 'forming anchor'. these were enacted through people valuing their personal, social, religious and political freedom and recognising the importance of maintaining or forming strong social and family networks. when researching the experiences of torres strait islanders it will be necessary to focus on motivations for moving, and understand the processes for staying connected to kin and homeland in order to achieve the desired outcomes of successful resettlement under conditions of uncertainty.	sociology
"many of those working in various fields of philosophy are familiar with edwin abbott's fascinating little book, flatland: a romance of many dimensions.1 among other things, abbott sought to examine the difficulties and possibilities involved in discussing how one might speak about dimensions of reality that transcend the limitations of one's own experience. in particular, his focus was on how someone living in a three dimensional ""sphere land"" could explain that dimension of reality to someone dwelling in a two dimensional ""flatland."" in this essay i should like to explore the application of thomas aquinas' notion of ""analogies of proportionality"" to the dynamics described by abbott, with specific reference to the possibility of communication about a transcendent, divine reality, namely, god. in the end i shall also introduce the insights of ian ramsey involving ""qualified models"" and ""cosmic disclosures"" by way of refining aquinas' notion and thereby illuminating how we humans might speak both helpfully and responsibly about god. my goal is to make a positive contribution to the on-going debate about the meaningfulness of god-talk. abbott introduces his exploration of the difficulties involved in ""inter-dimensional"" discourse with a brief discussion of those arising in the possibility of communication between a person living in one-dimensional ""line land"" and one who dwells in a non-dimensional ""point land."" how would the former go about trying to describe his/her experienced reality to the latter? perhaps the best that could be done would be to speak analogically of a series of ""points"" all lined up in a row, but it is not clear how a ""point person"" would be able to comprehend the meaning of the term ""row."" the same sort of difficulties would arise if a person dwelling in a two-dimensional ""flatland"" tried to explain that reality to one living in ""line land."" an effort could be made to speak analogically of lines extended in different directions ""perpendicular"" to the ""line person's"" experiential reality. once again, it is unclear how, or even if, the latter would be able to comprehend the terms ""perpendicular"" and/or ""different directions."" sometimes these difficulties are said to require ""upward analogies,"" and the problem then becomes how or whether this locution is even meaningful, let alone helpful. abbott's main focus, however, is on how and whether a person residing in a three dimensional ""sphere land"" would be able to communicate something of that reality to one living in a two-dimensional ""flatland."" even at this level of experience and discourse, we would seem to encounter the same difficulties already outlined in connection with the first two efforts at ""trans-dimensional"" communication. in short, is it at all possible to speak meaningfully of a dimension of reality that transcends that of another person without falling into either contradictions and/or emptiness? abbott suggests that his ""sphere land"" person might begin by asking the ""flatland"" person to expand the notion and experience of a circle to include a yet ""broader"" or ""richer"" direction that might give rise to the possibility and/or experience of ""depth."" of course, the ""flatlander"" initially claims to have no idea what is meant by this way of speaking, but perhaps by twisting this way and that he/she might be able to grasp some vague idea of what is meant by the locutions 'sphere' and 'depth'. au of the terms employed at every one of these dimensional intersections of discourse are understood to be metaphors. abbott's specific technique, no doubt arising from his interest in geometry, involves extrapolating from the number of points comprising a given figure to those comprising a larger, different figure. a person dwelling in ""pointland"" experiences but a single point, while a person dwelling in ""lineland"" experiences two points, twice that experienced by a person in ""lineland."" correspondingly, a person dwelling in ""flatland"" would experience four points, twice that of a person in ""line land,"" even as a person dwelling in ""sphere land"" would experience eight points, double that of what the ""flatlander"" experiences. …"	sociology

although there are existing philosophical accounts of utang-na-loob (debt of good will) and the suggestion that this filipino cultural practice can be considered a virtue is not new, questions remain about how morally desirable forms of utang-na-loob can be separated from its problematic involvement in nepotism, patronage politics, life-long servitude, corruption, and other forms of injustice. in this paper, i develop a practical and empirically grounded account of utang-na-loob as a filipino virtue by using a neo-aristotelian framework that allows for the incorporation of research from the social sciences into virtue-theoretic recommendations for action. i argue that utang-na-loob must be understood in conjunction with a distinctly filipino understanding of justice (katarungan), especially on what counts as fair distribution of resources and opportunities, to promote culturally rooted social harmony (pagkakaisa) and communal flourishing. the paper ends with a brief discussion of a case to demonstrate how utang-na-loob can be lived out in a morally desirable way.	sociology
the category disability is not fixed and absolute, but can be, and indeed has been, defined in a variety of different ways throughout history, within particular societies and in any given social context. the fact that definitions of disability are relative rather than absolute has led some sociologists in particular to conclude that disability can only be properly understood as a social construction. in common-sense usage, dependency implies the inability to do things for oneself and consequently the reliance upon others to carry out some or all of the tasks of everyday life. conversely independence suggests that the individual needs no assistance whatever from anyone else and this fits nicely with the current ideological climate which stresses competitive individualism. in reality, of course no one in a modern industrial society is completely independent for we live in a state of mutual interdependence. the dependence of disabled people, therefore, is not feature which marks them out as different in kind from the rest of the population but as different in degree. independent living forms part of the terms of the international civil rights movement of disabled people. the un declaration of rights of disabled persons asserted the rights of disabled people to be self-reliant, to live as they choose and to participate in the social, creative and recreational activities of their communities. for many disabled people, unwanted dependence on others would disappear overnight if they lived in a physical environment which did not handicap them. those who need personal assistance to enable them to live in their own homes have too often been consigned either to institutions or to enforced dependence on their families. through this paper, relevant theories of independent living for the disabilities such as demedicalization, deinstitutionalization, social integration and normalization were presented, also transitional process and characteristics of the disability models were presented as well.	sociology
objective: to analyze the meanings given by health professionals to the concepts, causes and repercussions of sexual violence against women. methods: qualitative study conducted with higher degree health professionals of the multiprofessional team of nine public hospitals in the municipality of fortaleza, ceara, between august and december using semi-structured interviews to collect data that underwent thematic analyses of the themes that emerged. results: the main meanings given to the concept of sexual violence were the violation of human rights and the emphasis on the perpetuation of gender issues; the main causes were misogyny, the existence of pathologies in the aggressors, the reproduction of family violence – the repercussions affect psychological aspects and lead to the exposure to disease and physical assaults. conclusion: the study enabled the analysis of the meanings given to sexual violence from the perspective of the professionals interviewed, who presented different views regarding gender inequality and social context. the causes highlighted were misogyny, women’s lack of information on their rights and social issues. it was observed that professionals had difficulties addressing the issue.	sociology

as a profound characteristic of humanity that cannot be circumvented or dismissed, faith, religion and religious practices are ubiquitous. there is a direct link between the propagation of religions and education. despite the fact that faith is a matter of intensely personal conviction, religious practices inevitably have communal and public dimensions, whereby society is directly involved. since religion is foundational to strong and often oppositional convictions, it is essential that the state as keeper of the social peace is involved in regulating the repercussions of religious practices in society. the question here is how successful the south african educational system currently is in its regulation of religion in the classroom for the purposes of maintaining balance in this multireligious society.	sociology
our lived experience is that of a mixed reality. the online and the offline—the real and the virtual—are becoming increasingly blurred and enmeshed. humans take on the virtual form of avatars to interact in cybernetic virtual environments. computers become ‘social actors’ interacting face-to-face with human audiences through the screen interface or by leaving the screen to interact as physically embodied robotic entities. this paper investigates the phenomenological nature of our embodied and lived experiences with both screen-based and physically embodied entities and explores the way sensorial and emotional affects are distributed between the physical and the virtual. examples are drawn from a range of new media art projects focusing on the audience experience of different screen-based (virtual) and embodied (robotic) entities and the mixed reality terrains they inhabit with their human audiences.	sociology

according to aristotelian rhetoric and to the new rhetoric studies, by perelman and olbrechts-tyteca (2014), the aim of argumentation was related to the spirits adherence: the speaker should pursue a consensus along with the audience. however, in present-day society, this intention makes room for the cultivation of polemics, characterizing what amossy (2017a; 2017b) classifies as the rhetoric of dissention. in order to present their opinion, some people draw on ad hominem arguments, directly attacking the person of their opponent instead of his/her arguments (fiorin, 2015). therefore, this paper analyzes polemics established during the strike made by teachers from rio grande do sul in 2017. we aim at studying how the commentator-readers of portal g1 rs have constructed their discourses, by means of ad hominem arguments, besides of pointing out possible representations of the strike teachers assumed by those readers. among the comments we have collected, present ad hominem arguments. from this last group, are analyzed in this paper. the analysis is organized in two sets: (1) analysis of the comments, considering the definition of polemic discourse (amossy, 2017b); (2) categorization of the comments, in order to evidence the representations of the strike teachers assumed by the readers. the results indicate that the personal attack to the teachers can be framed into two perspectives: (1) part of the readers ascribes to the teachers the role of militants, mainly on the left; (2) the other segment considers the teachers’ behavior as inappropriate. in brief, we have noticed that the comments, inside a discourse of dissention, raised a number of accusations in order to delegitimize the claims made by the teachers from the public system.	sociology

"the fourth amendment protects people against ""unreasonable searches"" by police. to operationalize this protection, courts must have a workable definition of a search. since the supreme court has used the two-step katz test as a primary measure of when a search has occurred. under katz, a court will find that something has been subject to search when (1) the individual in question has a subjective expectation of privacy in that thing and (2) such an expectation of privacy would be reasonable. from early on, commentators have decried the katz test as circular and have urged courts to adopt something else. this essay explains what the circularity worry really amounts to: the worry is about courts using improperly reduced expectations of privacy as a reason to withhold fourth amendment protection. this worry is much broader than most commentators have seen, and this broader framing allows one to deflect recent concerns that katz circularity (more narrowly construed) is a myth. with the ‘circularity’ worry properly understood, the essay offers a way to deal with it: courts could simply drop step one of katz."	sociology
as is well-known, the reference of singular terms in natural languages often depends on the context of utterance. a token of'i', for example, refers to the person who utters that token, a token of 'now' refers to a period of time which includes the moment when this token is uttered, and so on. in the fifties, some philosophers thought that reference was always a pragmatic, contextual matter; and this view is again current among contemporary linguists and philosophers working on the pragmatics of natural languages. does this mean that all referring expressions are 'indexical', like 'now' or 'i'? obviously they are not. a definite description like 'the president of the united states of america in 1986' is surely not indexical in the ordinary sense. but then, how are we to understand the claim that reference is always contextdependent? can we make that claim consistent with due recognition of the fact that not all singular terms are indexical? this is the question i will try to answer in this paper. i hasten to add that i will not be concerned with trivial forms of contextdependence, such as the dependence of reference on the language being spoken. there might exist a language, say lambdese, where the words 'the president of the usa in 1986' mean the same as the english description 'the inventor of the zip'; supposing julius to be the inventor of the zip, the description 'the president of the usa in 1986', uttered in a context where lambdese and not english is spoken, would refer to julius and not to ronald reagan. this form of contextdependence is trivial and will be set aside in this paper; i will always consider the language spoken as fixed. contextdependence will be deemed non-trivial and worthy of consideration only to the extent that a given expression, with a fixed meaning, makes in different contexts different contributions to	sociology
this article investigates valley of the wolves— iraq as a cinematic text produced and widely consumed in domestic and international cinema markets. by placing a non-western movie in the analysis of film studies, the authors claim to situate the film in a three-part analysis that has received less attention from other disciplines. first, the film can be situated as a cinematic challenge to the american media representation of the iraq war and to the bush administration’s “war on terror” discourse in so-called unstable regions. in addition, valley of the wolves—iraq attempts to negotiate and contest the meaning and the depiction of the war discourse in iraq brought to bear by american popular, practical, and formal geopoliticians by reproducing the cinematic space and retelling stories of the war from the “other” vantage point. second, the film in its own right can be located as a cultural product that attempts to consolidate the geopolitical imaginations of turkey in the middle east and the world. third, this study aims to formalize audience interpretation of such political entertainment using empirical techniques. in this context, the critical question is how and to what extent this film plays a representational role within turkish society and how it affects audiences’ geopolitical perceptions.	sociology

at the heart of the christian message lies an invitation to belong. or perhaps it’s an invitation to recognise that we already belong. we belong with the one in whose image we are made; the one who is both our origin and our final destiny. we believe that the god with whom we belong has sealed that belonging in the events of the life, death and resurrection of jesus christ. through the holy spirit, god has made a home within us, a foretaste of the eternal home we shall have in god. yet christian belonging goes beyond the internal and spiritual life. we belong through and with the routines of our lives, the special events we mark out, the people we have around us and the places with which we identify. we are invited to immerse ourselves in these belongings, and to be the means by which others, whether they share our faith or not, are afforded a rich experience of human belonging too. for me, this is where the imperative for christians to engage in questions of housing emerges. what are the things that you and i must have, by way of housing, if we are to be able to feel that we truly belong? what are the factors in britain’s housing situation today, and across the wider world, that enable or inhibit human belonging? and what can we do to impact upon them for good? i’ve tried, in what follows, to set out the main constituents of a home where a household can belong, beginning from the most physical characteristics of the spaces we seek to inhabit.	sociology

this thesis explores the ways in which taste is mobilized as a sensory, cultural, and political force in contemporary western societies. my explorations derive from a context in which there is a growing dissatisfaction with the quality of food and this is seen as severely impacting upon social and cultural structures and institutions and as altering people's health, habits and ways of life. this thesis investigates in what way taste and people's sensuous engagement with food offers insight into the nature of relations between people, food, and environs. it further examines how such relations tackle the transmogrification of food and the systems supporting it, how these surpass dichotomous views of fast and slow food, and how these redefine essential dimensions of what it is that constitutes food and eating. i show that taste, rather than being a static attribute which determines people's choices and status, is an active process of exploring, learning, and knowing. the analysis of relations between people, food and the senses is grounded in ethnographic research pursued with the slow food movement in britain. this international organization, originating in italy, advocates that the education of taste is imperative and people need to develop and deepen their knowledge about food by eating produce which is produced, sourced, sold and prepared in sustainable and equitable ways. the thesis discusses discursive and embodied ways of engaging with food and proposes approaching the formation and training of taste in terms of patterns of perceptual experience. in highlighting food tasting as a sensory practice, i introduce the notion of sensory pageantry and evaluate several tensions and contestations around speedier and slower modalities of experiencing taste. thus, i demonstrate that training techniques of remembering, repeating, rebalancing and fine-tuning hone taste into a skill and mode of knowing. this thesis argues that taste is relational and multi-sensuous. methodologically, this thesis takes an interdisciplinary perspective and draws on arguments, concepts and theories from anthropology and sociology, cultural geography and ecological psychology. furthermore, this thesis introduces storytelling as a way of 'capturing' the evanescent and fleeting character of taste.	sociology

this chapter argues for an approach to teaching english as a second or foreign language that acknowledges the globalized, hybrid identities of students, moving within and between communities and nations. most state-mandated, standardized english language development (eld) curricula and assessment regimes are one-size-fits-all competitive systems that homogenize english language learners, producing and maintaining inequities between “native” and “non-native” speakers. the predominant deficit-based eld programs reflect a colonial history that commodifies language and contributes to a “monocultural restoration.” eld practices and policies that focus on seemingly neutral, decontextualized skill-building are part of this colonial project. decolonizing 21st-century eld pedagogies requires moving away from conceptions of learning as an abstract process of knowledge acquisition and reconceptualizing learning as identity-making practice. decolonized eld pedagogies would further incorporate and encourage the hybrid ways transnational students use multiple languages and literacies in “third spaces,” as they intersubjectively construct and expand their identities in practice.	sociology

this article explores from a broadly philosophical perspective a range of complexities of normative judgment relating to “school choice” in a liberal democratic society. it is argued that “heavy” conceptions of public education in such societies play an important role in philosophical discussions of school choice by indicating constraints and limits to school choice arising from the specification of an educational entitlement that should be secured for all students. the article also argues that forms of practical judgment by teachers and educational leaders at the classroom and school level are central to the interpretation and implementation of such “heavier” forms of educational influence. attention to this neglected point is argued to be of significance for the deployment of arguments regarding heavier conceptions of public education in debates relating to school choice.	sociology

relevance of research. the problem of health decline of the younger generation is becoming increasingly important. at present, the overalllevel of health deviation of children in russia is annually increasing by 7%. because of modern lifestyle, most adults have weak motivation for physical activity and low perceptions about healthy lifestyle as well as the sport.implementing this policy, the state allocates substantial funding for the development of children’s and youth sport. interests of the state are the following: efficient use of physical culture and sports to bring up patriotism of citizens, to prepare them for the protection of the country and serve in the army, health promotion, maintaining high availability and competitiveness of able-bodied persons in the labor market. the state is interested in the efficient development of sports and recreational clubs that make up such an important segment of the sports industry as a recreational sport, as provision of sports and recreational services to the population affects the formation of healthy lifestyle, improvement in public health and the quality of human resources of the national economy. holding in russia sochi olympic games significantly affected the increase of winter sport popularity, the interest increased by percent. russian sports minister vitaly mutko has said that it is still not enough for such a big country as russia. the problem of further improving athletic training is not merely a search for new methods of training and selection, but most of all, a broad involvement of children to sports with further sports orientation. the object of study is children’s and youth sports in the city of sochi. the purpose of the study is to determine the level of realization of state programs for thedevelopment of children’s and youth sport in the city of sochi. research methods and organization: analysis and synthesis of data from li terature and internet resources; the method of mathematical statistics, processing the study results. conclusions and suggestions. the most important link in the development of youth sport and its basement in the education system have always been and still remain youth sport schools which has trained many champions of russia, europe, world and olympic games. in connection with the preparation and holding of sochi olympic games - there was a significant increase in children’s and youth sport schools. to day children’s sports schools are already active in sochi. further development of youth sport cannot go on the only way of increasing the number of sports schools. the development of youth sports could also be contributed by the establishment of sports clubs at educational institutions. proper organizing of the educational process at primary school, high school, and vocational school is unthinkable without the involvement of young people to the sport necessary to improve their lifestyle and mental performance. in addition, the creation of such sport clubs will help youth sport schools to select young athletes more qualitatively,more effectively implement their natural potential and to provide favorable conditions for the improvement in the chosen sport. keywords: health, children’s and youth sports, sports schools, legacy of the games, the olympic facilities.	sociology
"grant hutchison (frightened rabbit): “this book should be mandatory reading for every label, booking agent, manager and tour manager in the business of music and touring so we can all better understand what’s really involved in living the life of a professional musician and the role we all have in making that life as liveable as possible” emma warren (music journalist and author): ""musicians often pay a high price for sharing their art with us. underneath the glow of success can often lie loneliness and exhaustion, not to mention the basic struggles of paying the rent or buying food. sally-anne gross and george musgrave raise important questions – and we need to listen to what the musicians have to tell us about their working conditions and their mental health"" crispin hunt (multi-platinum songwriter/record producer & chair of the ivor’s academy): “singing is crying for grown ups. to create great songs or play them with meaning music's creators reach far into emotion and fragility seeking the communion we demand of it. the world loves music for bridging those lines. however, music’s toll on musicians can leave deep scars. in this important book, sally anne gross and george musgrave investigate the relationship between the well-being music brings to society and the well-being of those who create. it's a much needed reality-check, deglamorising the romantic image of the tortured artist” adam ficek (psychotherapist [music and mind]/babyshambles): “ a critical and timely book which is sure to kick start further conversations around musicians, mental health and the music industry” joe muggs (dj, promoter, journalist [guardian, telegraph, fact, mixmag, the wire]): “the best guide to what being a musician, and what ""the music industry"" actually are that i can remember reading... it manages to capture and quantify so much about how we value emotion, creativity, labour, relationships, time, other people, [and] ourselves, in the information economy” mykaell riley (bass culture, director of black music research unit): ‘whether you’re or any age, one’s relationship with music is for life. for many creatives, for better or for worse, that relationship is the meaning of life. music might be a universal language, but we could all benefit by being a little more fluent. can music make you sick … is a great place to start’. ----- it is often assumed that creative people are prone to psychological instability, and that this explains apparent associations between cultural production and mental health problems. in their detailed study of recording and performing artists in the british music industry, sally anne gross and george musgrave turn this view on its head. by listening to how musicians understand and experience their working lives, this book proposes that whilst making music is therapeutic, making a career from music can be traumatic. the authors show how careers based on an all-consuming passion have become more insecure and devalued. artistic merit and intimate, often painful, self-disclosures are the subject of unremitting scrutiny and data metrics. personal relationships and social support networks are increasingly bound up with calculative transactions. drawing on original empirical research and a wide-ranging survey of scholarship from across the social sciences, their findings will be provocative for future research on mental health, wellbeing and working conditions in the music industries and across the creative economy. going beyond self-help strategies, they challenge the industry to make transformative structural change. until then, the book provides an invaluable guide for anyone currently making their career in music, as well as those tasked with training and educating the next generation"	sociology

in this chapter, i present findings from two school visits that i conducted as part of an ethnographic research on inclusive education in colombia, south america. in colombia, inclusive education has been a legal right since 1994. furthermore, in colombia ratified the convention on rights of persons with disabilities demonstrating a commitment to inclusive education. however, evidence shows that the participation of all children in education is far from a reality in this country as many groups remain excluded from the education system. one such group are children with special educational needs/disabilities (sen/d), a staggering percentage of which are currently out of school. interestingly, there is limited systematic research on inclusive education in colombia. with my ethnographic research, i explored (a) inclusive education in practice, (b) teacher preparation for inclusive education, and (c) understanding of inclusive education within this context. in this chapter, i will focus on the first point, and i will reflect on findings from visits to two very different colombian schools, in order to generate some discussion regarding current possibilities and challenges in relation to the inclusion of children with sen/d in education in colombia.	sociology

theological liberalists presuppose as a self-evident thesis that homosexuality is a normal sexual love like heterosexuality and then develop arguments for same-sex marriage. first, the purpose of marriage is to provide an arena for the training for sanctification. there is no proper reason why this good opportunity must not be given to homosexuals. second, marriage is the model of the spiritual marriage between christ and the church. the fact that christ, who is man, is the bridegroom for male-believers in this spiritual marriage supports same-sex marriage. third, just as natural biological children are transferred into unnatural adoption and grafted into the kingdom of god, so the concept of marriage must be extended more broadly by grafting unnatural same-sex marriage into natural heterosex marriage. fourth, just as christ did not oppress his desire for the church but satisfied and elevated it into agape in the frame of spiritual marriage with his church, so a sexual desire of homosexuals must be satisfied. but their sexual desire cannot be satisfied in the heterosexual marriage. so satisfying the sexual desire of homosexuals requires a legitimate frame of same-sex marriage. fifth, homosexuals belong to the category of the people who are the objects of the blessings given through abraham. these arguments understand marriage only as the aspects of the salvation order like a model for the union between christ and churches and an arena for the training for sanctification and ignore its features as one of the creation order. the result is that the spectrum of marriage becomes smaller illegitimately and the features of marriage as the creation order are discarded. marriage is a peculiar order which can be formed only between man and woman, and complements the deficiencies of the genital organs. but this complementary function cannot work in same-sex marriage. sexual activities between same-sex people cannot be justified, for they are the grotesque ones in which genital organs and an excretive organ meet each other. giving birth children is an important purpose of marriage, even though not the primary one, but it is never possible in same-sex marriage. marriage functions as a shield against fornication. so it is very morally grotesque to do sexual relation between same-sex people in marriage, for the very sexual activities between same-sex people have been regarded as the legitimate reasons for divorce, for divorce can be permitted due to legitimate reasons.	sociology
in this chapter we focus on rural women, a group that is reported to face a “double disadvantage” due to their gender and rural place of residence. we argue that gendered and place constructions of ‘good’ rural women and the roles ‘good’ women should play in rural communities, intersect with the values of place and community that, in earlier work, we have argued may characterise rural health ethics. gender and place stereotypes can have positive and negative implications for rural women and rural communities more generally. but the intersections between these stereotypes and these values may also impact on rural women and their access to health services. we examine rural women’s access to health services across multiple dimensions, including availability, affordability, accessibility, acceptability and accommodation. if the ability of rural women to access health services is influenced by gendered and place constructions of their role and the values of place and/or community, this is of importance when considering how health services should be designed and delivered.	sociology

the male body in digital culture explores different ways that the male body has been represented by, constructed in, and experienced through digital media during the age of austerity. it argues that the male body has become a key site in contemporary culture where neoliberalism’s hegemony has been both secured and contested since 2008. it does this by looking at three different case studies: the celebrity male nude leak; the rise of young men sharing images of their muscular bodies on social networking sites; and the rise of chemsex. it finds that on the one hand digital media has enabled men to transform their bodies into tools of value-creation in an economic context when their traditional bread-winning capacities have been diminished. on the other it has also allowed them to use their bodies to form intimate collective bonds during a moment when competitive individualism continues to be insisted on as the privileged mode of being in the world. it therefore offers a unique contribution not only to the field of digital cultural studies but also to the growing cultural studies literature attempting to map the historical contradictions of the austerity moment.	sociology

the debate in this article is based on the premise that any play is a play with death - be it russian roulette, gladiator fights, children's war games in which the loser symbolically dies : 'you are killed!' here one may include the computer game, which is known officially as 'volfenstein', but unofficially 'the shooting game' or 'the killing game'. in this game the player sitting in front of a computer screen has to kill as many 'fascists' as possible, otherwise they will kill his virtual image. the duel, too, is yet another form of play-like behaviour. in some instances, a person who has lost a large sum of money playing roulette or cards commits suicide. another game that may be considered in this context is blind-man's-buff (zhmurki); the course of the game amplifies its thematic meaning : the blind is looking for the sighted, the dead is looking for the living. in the end, all binary oppositions in culture can be summed up by the opposition between life and death : happiness-unhappiness; good-bad; own-foreign; animated-unanimated; known-unknown; affirmation-negation; to be-not to be, and so forth. as wittgenstein maintains, all human activity represents the sum total of language games. the entire world of culture, which is imprinted in universal binary oppositions, relates to death. the hypothesis that all games are a play with death, is derived from this.	sociology

when i first came to the law of evidence many years ago as a law student, i was immediately fascinated by its many hues and textures. here was a subject unlike any other. it was neither substantive nor entirely procedural; it rested upon archaic english foundations except when it did not; it had rationalist undertones but was replete with utterly counter-intuitive rules and propositions; it seduced with its tantalising ideas and concepts, yet frustrated with its reluctance to break free of hidebound thinking. in south africa, in particular, where we had inherited a system based on jury trials, much seemed ripe for reconsideration and reform.in short, i was quickly hooked. there seemed to be few other areas where an academic could so happily do what he enjoyed most - complain about the way things are and point out ways to make things better. as a young academic, i could not understand why the courts refused to embrace the challenge themselves. if, for instance, you have a rule that hearsay evidence should not be admitted because it is potentially unreliable and prejudicial, and you have a rule that hearsay is, accordingly, inadmissible unless it falls within a recognised, existing exception, how can you defend a position that no new exceptions can be created when you accept (as you must) that the existing exceptions cannot possibly be exhaustive and that instances must arise where reliable hearsay evidence demands, in the interests of justice, to be received?	sociology

there is a growing consensus that sustainability and happiness are interrelated—while happiness promotes sustainable behaviours, sustainable behaviours enhance happiness. however, there are other factors linking sustainability and happiness. in this chapter, we identify the missing link as spirituality. our exploration differentiates spirituality from religion and presents it in rational and scientific terms and points out how individuals become intrinsically happier and behave in sustainable ways as they grow spiritually. spirituality can be the source of both happiness and sustainability and, ultimately, enhanced community well-being. drawing on this understanding, we then develop a theoretical framework for sustainable personal and community development that is holistic and can help foster understanding of the role of spirituality in happiness and well-being, including in the neighbourhood context.	sociology

dissemination, the second stage of experimental social innovation and dissemination (esid) is a critical, if not defining, element of this social change model. this paper attempts to assess the extent to which community psychology has adopted and implemented esid's dissemination focus in its training and publications. we identify four levels of commitment to dissemination: dissemination advocate, dissemination activist, dissemination researcher, and experimental dissemination researcher. content analyses of textbooks, journal publications, and conference papers and a brief survey of doctoral training in the field were conducted. findings suggest that the dissemination aspects of esid have been modestly and partially implemented within the field. that is, although there is some evidence of a commitment to dissemination practice (advocate, activist), there is much less evidence of a commitment to dissemination research. the implications of these findings for the effectiveness of the esid model and for training and practice in community psychology are discussed.	sociology
this book traces the long-term genesis of the sixth-century roman legal penalty of forced monastic penance. the late antique evidence on this penal institution runs counter to a scholarly consensus that roman legal principle did not acknowledge the use of corrective punitive confinement. dr hillner argues that forced monastic penance was a product of a late roman penal landscape that was more complex than previous models of roman punishment have allowed. she focuses on invigoration of classical normative discourses around punishment as education through christian concepts of penance, on social uses of corrective confinement that can be found in a vast range of public and private scenarios and spaces, as well as on a literary christian tradition that gave the experience of punitive imprisonment a new meaning. the book makes an important contribution to recent debates about the interplay between penal strategies and penal practices in the late roman world.	sociology

abstract the complicated ideological terrain of a tribal school wrestles with aims of self-determination, academic success, and the legacy of settler colonial violence and theft through institutionalized schooling. one effect of these challenges is the ‘two-worlds’ approach to education for indigenous students that categorizes linguistic and social practices as either ‘indigenous’ or ‘modern’ ( lee, , wilson and kamanā, ). though this approach has long been recognized as problematic, it persists in indigenous schooling contexts. this study employs a critical multimodal social semiotic ( kress, 2011a , kress, 2011b ) approach to language and sign to examine how school and community members invoke, reject, and reimagine ideologies from disparate cultural sources within a single event: one ojibwe tribal school's kindergarten graduation ceremony. contextualized with data from a larger ethnographic project, i extend meek's (2011) work with disjunctures to call attention to the ‘institutional repertoires’ that shape the teaching and learning therein across multiple modes.	sociology

abstract customary and religious laws and practices are often used as tools to control women's sexuality and to maintain the imbalance of power in sexual relations.. this paper describes customary and religious laws and beliefs and their impact on the situation ofboth rural and urban women in eastern turkey, based on a study among women from the region, most of whom are or have been married. it shows that early marriage and polygyny are still prevalent religious marriage still takes place earlier than civil marriage although the former is not legallybinding, forced marriages still take place and arranged marriages are still the majority, though more younger women expected to be able to choose theirpartners. the study also finds that most women would feel unable to seek divorce if their husbands had an extra-marital relationship, but many women feared the custom of so-called honour killing if they are suspected of such an affair. next to none of the women had ever sought legal recourse against domestic violence or marital rape, though these are commonly experienced. a human rights training programme for women, a public awareness campaign against honour killings of women accused of adultery, and a campaign to alter the turkish criminal code have been set up to address some of these issues.	sociology
"this paper aims to analyze entrepreneurship by exploring the theoretical and methodological implications proposed by the actor-network theory (ant). broadly speaking, we considered two theoretical perspectives for entrepreneurship: the subjectivist and the objectivist. the subjectivist perspective emphasizes the individual, with his skills and inherent abilities. less explored in the literature, the objectivist perspective emphasizes the material aspects of the environment that cause entrepreneurship. considering both, the main limitation is the little importance that each side gives to the influence of the other in the overall analysis of the processes. this theoretical evidence reveals asymmetries, which display the insertion of the ant application. disregarding the duality imposed by the initial perspectives, the ant enabled the exploration of new possibilities for understanding through the concept of ""symmetry"" (bloor 1976; latour 2005; latour e woolgar, 1997). in this way, the ant considers all entities as hybrids: they are formed at the same time from subjectivity and objectivity. this argument is divergent with the asymmetric way of accessing the reality, which reproduces a dual vision of it, even recognizing that both subjective and objective aspects contribute to the success or failure of entrepreneurial initiatives. thus, entrepreneurship requires the mobilization of diverse assemblages around itself, which necessitates the gathering of several allies who will be part of a negotiated movement and translations of interests. uncovering this movement reveals the multiplicity of relationships that involves, for instance, political, social, economic, cultural, scientific and technological factors, as well as the protagonists who, in history, usually are considered entrepreneurs."	sociology

the objectives of the present study aim at knowing the factors that contribute to the decision to continue studying in university education for students; identifying critical aspects of rural students' access to qualification and identifying measures to improve access for students from rural areas to universities. the study is a qualitative-exploratory one, based on the focus group method. seven focus groups were organized at the west university of timisoara, romania, with personnel involved in the development of university education programs: teachers, rural students and social services employers. the research tool was the moderation guide, having as main topics the students' motivation to continue their studies, the process of admission to the university, the admission process, proposals for improving the access of rural students to the university. the results of this study have an essential instrumental value in terms of developing measures to improve the access of rural students to qualification in university education programs.	sociology
based on primary research and consultations conducted over the last four years in the north of ireland, this article considers the lives and experiences of children and young people in communities where the legacy of conflict and economic deprivation are most marked. it explores the reality of differential policing in communities where paramilitaries filled the policing deficit during the conflict through informal 'justice' and punishment beatings. finally, it considers the potential for change in a climate increasingly hostile towards children and young people, and the realisation of their rights.	sociology
the theory of politeness of brown and levinson (1978, 1987) has remained the most seminal and influential starting point for cross-cultural and cross-linguistic contrastive pragmatics. yet is has also provoked countervailing arguments from ide (1989, 1993), matsumoto (1989), gu (1990), mao (1994) and others, pointing out a western bias in brown and levinson's theory, particularly in their individualistic and egalitarian motivations, as opposed to the more group-centred hierarchy-based ethos of eastern societies. this leads to the question in thetitle of this article: is there an east-west divide in politeness?the following argument will be presented. there is an overarching framework for studying linguistic politeness phenomena in communication: a common principle of politeness (leech, 1983,2002) and a grand strategy of politeness (gsp), which is evident in common linguistic behaviour patterns in the performance of polite speech acts such as requests, offers, compliments, apologies,thanks, and responses to these. the gsp says simply: in order to be polite, a speaker communicates meanings which (a) place a high value on what relates to the other person (typically the addressee),(major constraint) and (b) place a low value on what relates to the speaker. (minor constraint). it is clear from many observations that constraint (a) is more powerful than constraint (b). the following hypothesis will be put forward, and supported by very limited evidence: that the gsp provides a very general explanation for communicative politeness phenomena in eastern languages such as chinese,japanese and korean, as well as in western languages such as english. this is not to deny the importance of quantitative and qualitative differences in the settings of social parameters and linguistic parameters of politeness in such languages. a framework such as the gsp provides the parameters of variation within which such differences can be studied.hence this article argues in favour of the conclusion that, despite differences, there is no eas	sociology

the principal agenda of this work is to explore the obvious disconnect between education curriculum in africa and the continent’s indigenous knowledge systems. africa’s persisting social and economic challenges is examined and questions are raised on the region’s paradigms of development, which are largely foreign. it shall be established in this chapter that for education to advance society, it must be relevant to the needs of the people concerned and be appropriate to the social and material environments in which it is pursued. education must also be adaptive and cumulative—that is, responding to the exigencies of situations and be meaningful to members of the society, taking into account their aspirations and concepts of development.	sociology
